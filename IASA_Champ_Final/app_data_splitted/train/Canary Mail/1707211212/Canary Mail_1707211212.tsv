I'm leaving! Yes, you read it right—I'm quitting! But don't worry, it's not because of your office karaoke skills or those questionable dance moves at the holiday party. I've simply discovered my untapped potential as a stand-up comedian. Time to turn my humor into a career!

Goodbye, cubicle. Hello, spotlight!
Thanks for everything and keep laughing,

Best regards,
