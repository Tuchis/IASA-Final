The UI interface in the image presents a window with a split layout. The left side of the window features a vertical navigation menu with the following elements:

1. A button labeled "General" with an associated gear icon.
2. A button labeled "Workflows" with an associated lightning bolt icon which appears to be selected or active, highlighted by a surrounding shape.
3. A button labeled "Shortcuts" with an associated keyboard icon.
4. A button labeled "License" with an associated checkmark icon.

At the top of the window, there's a window control header with:

1. Standard window control buttons (three circles typical on a macOS interface, suggesting this is an application window on a Mac).
2. The title of the app or window appears to be "Almighty".

On the right side of the window, it looks like a content area with the following elements:

1. A header labeled "Workflows".
2. Below the header, there is an item labeled "Favorite" with an associated star icon.
3. Adjacent to the "Workflows" header, there is a plus button, likely for adding a new workflow.
4. At the bottom, there is a text field with placeholder text that reads "Organize tweaks with workflows".

This sums up all the identifiable UI elements presented in the image.
