The UI interface displayed in the photo contains the following elements:

1. On the top left, it looks like a standard window control with three dots, typically indicating window management functions like close, minimize, and maximize.

2. Below that, on the left-hand side, there's a sidebar menu with the following items, each accompanied by an icon:
   - General
   - Menu Bar Items
   - Menu Bar Style
   - Presets (which seems to be the selected section, indicated by a different background tone and an arrow pointing right)
   - Triggers
   - Hotkeys
   - Advanced
   - About

3. In the top-middle area of the main panel, there is a title "Presets" followed by a description below that says "Create Presets that can be applied to change your menu bar item layout."

4. Below the title and description, there's a section with an outlined box that contains:
   - A header text saying "Default macOS menu bar items"
   - A subheading or description text below the header that says "Shows only the default menu bar items on a clean install of macOS, all other menu bar items are hidden. Great for screen recording or screen shots."
   - Two buttons to the right labeled "Settings" and "Apply"

5. Below the outlined box, there is a divider line suggesting that the area is meant to list multiple items or presets.

6. In the center of the outlined box, there's a large plus sign, indicating that this is probably a button to add a new preset.

7. At the bottom-right corner of the main panel, two buttons are visible:
   - "Delete Preset"
   - "Add Preset"
