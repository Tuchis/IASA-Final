The image shows a user interface of an app that appears to be used for configuring a Touch Bar on a computer. Here's a description of the UI elements visible in the photo:

1. At the top left of the window, there's a back navigation arrow.
2. Further right on the top bar, there's an icon indicating a "Touch Bar" view alongside a text button labeled "Touch Bar Settings."
3. There's also a pause button icon and a list icon in the top bar.
4. Next to these, there is a dropdown menu with "Preset: Default" text and three horizontally aligned dots indicating more options.
5. Below the top bar, a secondary header says "Groups & Top Level Triggers."
6. In the central part of the window, there is large text that reads "Add first Touch Bar Button/Widget for All Apps."
7. Below the text is a large rounded rectangle containing a plus icon, visually suggesting an action button for adding a new button or widget.
8. On the far left is a vertical sidebar containing icons and text for "All Apps" and "Finder," which indicates this may be a navigation or selection pane.
9. At the bottom of the left pane, there are two action buttons: one with a plus icon and another with a trash can icon.
10. At the bottom of that same sidebar is a magnifying glass icon, which typically indicates a search function.

These elements together suggest that the app is meant to manage and customize the Touch Bar on a compatible computer, offering options to add new buttons or widgets, configure settings for the Touch Bar, and navigate between different levels of customization options.
