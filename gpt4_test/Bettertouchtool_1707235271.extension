- A link to the documentation with the URL "https://docs.folivora.ai/docs/1200_notch_bar.html".

In the bottom section, there's an illustration showing the layout of the Notch Bar with labels:

- "Scrollable Left" next to it.
- "Notch" in the center.
- "Scrollable Right" to the right of the notch.
- "Mini Status Icon Area" next to "Scrollable Right".
