This application interface appears to be for tracking and managing bills. The UI is divided into three main columns or sections.

Left Column:
- There are multiple tabs which represent different views or sections of the application:
   - Bills:
       - Overview (selected) with an indication of "2 bills"
       - Due Soon with an indication of "1 bill - 270,00 UAH"
       - Due This Month with an indication of "1 bill - 270,00 UAH"
       - Paid Recently with an indication of "No Bills"
   - Reports:
       - Income
       - Forecast
       - Monthly History
       - Annual Spending
       - Archive

Middle Column:
- At the top, there are three buttons or icons for different functions (the icons are not described), as well as a dropdown menu labeled "All Items" and a search bar with the placeholder text "Search."
- Below this, there is a table with three columns titled "Name", "Amount", and "Due Date". It lists two items:
   1. Internet (with a note "Every month") for "270,00 UAH", and a due date labeled "Due today Mon, 5 Feb" accompanied by a colored indicator (not described).
   2. Netflix (with a note "Every month") for "440,00 UAH", and a due date labeled "Due in over 1 month Wed, 20 Mar" also accompanied by a colored indicator.

Right Column:
- The right section shows details for one of the items, which is Netflix in this case:
   - At the top, the word "Netflix" is displayed next to a check mark, implying this item is selected.
   - Below that, there is a back arrow and the word "Statistics" indicating the current view.
   - The statistics section is divided into two parts:
       - The first part provides two figures under "TOTAL PAID" and "AVERAGE" which both show "440,00 UAH".
       - The next part is titled "TOTALS BY YEAR" with entries for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, with only 2023 having a value of "440,00 UAH in 1 payments".
       - Below that is a "PAYMENTS BY MONTH" section listing dates and associated amounts for several months, with all amounts showing "0,00 UAH" aside from the most recent month.
- At the very bottom of this section, there are two buttons: "Archive" and "Edit".
