This UI interface shows a dashboard titled "Progress and speed records." At the top, there are dropdown options indicating a selection for language ("English") and keyboard layout ("QWERTY").

Below the title and options, there is a row of categories following which appear to be different lessons or skill levels. These are labeled "Lesson 1," "Lesson 2," "Lesson 3," "Lesson 4," "Lesson 5," "Lesson 6," "Expert," "Numbers," "Capitals," and "Punctuation." Each of these categories has a corresponding progress value (all set to "0") as well as a five-star rating element, most likely indicating the user's proficiency or completion status for that particular lesson or skill area.

Beneath these categories, there is a horizontal bar graph with many vertical bars of varying heights. This graph seems to represent an aspect of the user's performance over a series of activities or time intervals, possibly indicating results for speed and the number of typographical errors, as suggested by the labeled axes "Speed" and "Typos." To the left of the graph, a label reads "Results for recent activities," and there are two horizontal dashed lines across the graph suggesting thresholds or reference levels.

Additionally, on the top left of the interface, there are the standard window control buttons, which typically represent close, minimize, and expand/maximize actions on a window in an operating system interface. On the top right, there is a close button (marked with "x") for the dashboard or modal window itself.
