The image displays a welcome screen for an app, which seems to be titled "Merlin Project Express". At the top of the screen, there is a navigation bar with a button labeled "Get Started" aligned to the right side.

Below the navigation bar, there is a large heading that says "Welcome to Merlin Project Express" followed by a subheading that reads "Project management with a bit of magic".

The main part of the screen features a list of four key features or functionalities of the application, each accompanied by an associated icon:

1. **Work Breakdown & Gantt Chart** 
   - "Create the flow of your tasks, determine duration and dependencies, and define milestones."

2. **Resources & Assignments**
   - "Create your team and assign them to your tasks. Optionally, calculate labor costs per activity, phase, or entire project."

3. **Attachments**
   - "Attach any number of files and documents of any kind to tasks or resources in your project."

4. **Styling**
   - "Mark activities and design them as you like - individually or by rules."

At the bottom of the screen, there is a button labeled "Continue".

The screen is organized in a clean and simple layout, designed to inform a new user about the basic features of the app, encouraging them to get started with using the application.
