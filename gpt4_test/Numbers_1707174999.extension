The image displays a spreadsheet with various elements related to scheduling and course management. Starting from the top left and going to the right, I'll describe the UI elements and content visible:

1. The title bar reads "HumanAI_schedule2023_v3".
2. File menu buttons such as a folder icon, a cloud with an arrow indicating upload or save to cloud function, a printer icon, a paintbrush for formatting, and an eye-shaped icon likely for previewing the document. 
3. Viewing options including a magnifying glass with a "-" sign for zoom out, a percentage dropdown (currently at 125%), and a magnifying glass with a "+" sign for zoom in.
4. Add, Category, Pivot Table are three options for manipulating data.
5. Standard spreadsheet manipulation tools like Insert, Table, Chart, Text, Shape, Media, and Comment.
6. Collaboration tools indicated by an icon symbolising two figures for shared workspaces or shared editing.
7. Formatting, organizing, and sheet management tools represented by the Format, Organise, and a dropdown for Sheet options with a checkbox beside "Background," buttons for "Duplicate Sheet" and "Delete Sheet."

Below these controls is the actual spreadsheet content, which includes the following sections and information:

- A schedule organized by weeks, room numbers, days, and times. It specifically mentions rooms "HG-06A37" and "NU-4B43", indicating locations.
- Scheduled times and activities, such as "lecture times," "Monday Morning," "subject and slides," "texts," and "exercising times."
- Entries pertaining to various lectures, such as "Lecture 1: Introduction: Network-Oriented Modeling" and "Lecture 2: Designing Mental and Social Network Models" among others.
- References to textbooks like "Book 2 Ch. 2 Ins and Outs of Network-Oriented Modeling" and "Book 1 Ch 2. A Temporal-Causal Network Modeling Approach."
- Assignments are mentioned, such as "Assignment 1: Minitutorial for the Nonadaptive Matlab Template" and "Final Project Assignment."
- Lastly, the name "Lecturer Jan Treur" is visible, likely indicating the instructor responsible for these lectures and assignments.

The image shows various elements of a functional UI within a spreadsheet application, used for outlining a course schedule, including lectures, practical sessions, and assignments.
