The interface is of an application named "Reminders." At the very top of the interface, there are three circular icons which possibly represent navigation or status indicators. Below that is the app title "Reminders."

Below the title, there's a tally "12 Completed" followed by a hyperlink or button labeled "Clear." To the right, on the same line, there's a notification bell icon with a numbered badge displaying "8," indicating pending notifications, a menu button with three vertical dots, and a plus sign button which likely is used for adding new items or tasks.

The main section of the interface consists of a list of tasks or reminders. Each task has a circle to the left, which could be used to mark the task as complete. Next to the circle is the title of the task followed by its scheduled date and time. The tasks are:

1. "Put liquid for contact lenses," scheduled for "04/04/2021, 08:00"
2. "The same time two app," scheduled for "04/04/2021, 08:00" (identical time as the first, possibly a duplicate or related reminder)

At the very bottom of the interface, there are buttons for additional functions associated with a task entry. They are: an "Add Date" calendar button, an "Add Location" button denoted with a location pin icon, followed by a "Tags" button featuring a hashtag symbol, and finally, a photo icon that might be used to add images or attachments to a task.
