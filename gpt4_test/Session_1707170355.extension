The UI interface presented in the image is for a registration or login process. The main elements include:

1. A navigation bar at the top-left corner with three icons:
   - A back arrow icon that likely allows the user to go to the previous screen.
   - A musical note icon, which may be related to audio or media playback.
   - A closed captioning or subtitles icon potentially related to accessibility options or text display settings.

2. A digital clock displaying "00:32" which seems to be a timer or timestamp.

3. On the left border of the app, there are two additional icons:
   - A settings or gear icon at the bottom which usually indicates access to system settings or preferences.
   - An icon with three vertical lines and a square, which might be a menu or panel access icon.

4. In the central part of the screen, there is a white rectangle containing the main authentication UI elements:
   - Header text that reads "Synchronize your data between devices" suggesting a feature of the app.
   - A larger text that reads "Register / login" indicating the action that should be taken in this section.
   - A text field labeled "Email" where the user is supposed to enter their email address.
   - A button labeled "GET ONE-TIME PASSWORD" which is presumably to be pressed after entering an email, to receive a password for login.

This UI seems to offer a simplified authentication process using a one-time password sent to the user's email.
