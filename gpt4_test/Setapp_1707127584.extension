This image depicts a computer desktop with a user interface of an application. The interface is split into two main sections: a sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right.

On the left sidebar, there are multiple items:

1. A search field at the top with a magnifying glass icon and placeholder text that reads "Search." Next to the search field, there's a button denoted with the text "AI Assistant."
2. Below the search, there's a section with several items listed vertically:
   - An item labeled "My Explorer" with an associated icon.
   - An item labeled "Favorites" with a heart icon.
   - An item labeled "On This Mac" with a downward chevron and desktop computer icon.
   - A section titled "Collections" with items that appear to be indented:
     - "How-tos" with an associated icon.
     - "App Guides" with an associated icon.
   - An item named "All Apps" with an associated rightward chevron.
   - Below "All Apps," categories are listed: "Optimize," "Work," "Create," "Develop," each with a rightward chevron.

On the right, the main content area features a header that says "Rising stars of Setapp" followed by the subheading "Enjoy our less popular but highly-rated apps."

Below the heading, there's a list of applications with corresponding numbers from 1 to 10:

1. An application with the title "Make sure your text has no errors," accompanied by a percentage indicator showing "99%" and a tag that reads "Mac."
2. "Capture GIFs from your screen," accompanied by the same percentage indicator and tag.
3. "Turn images into icons," again with the percentage and tag.
4. "Get full-screen meeting alerts," similarly followed by the percentage and tag.
5. "Organize your icon sets," with the percentage and tag.
6. "Plain-text task management," with these indicators and tag.
7. "Capture snaps from your videos," with the indicators and tag.
8. "Manage multiple DBMS," with a slightly lower percentage ("98%") and two tags reading "Mac, iOS."
9. "Check your security settings," with the percentage and tag.
10. "Easily manage your files, notes & clipboard...," with the percentage and tag.

Between the header and the list of applications, there is a carousel with buttons on either side ("<" on the left and ">" on the right) that might be used to navigate through different views or slides within the main content area. The carousel shows an image of another application interface.

On the upper right corner of the main content area, there's an icon representing a person (indicating a user profile or team member account) with a blue checkmark and a notification badge with the number "24."
