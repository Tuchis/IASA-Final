The UI interface is of a calendar application. Here are the elements as observed:

1. Top Bar:
   - A navigation menu button on the far left, represented by three horizontal lines.
   - A left-pointing chevron (<) followed by a right-pointing chevron (>) surrounding the text "February 2024," suggesting navigation through months.
   - Three buttons on the far right: the first button appears to resemble a layout toggle or "today" button; the second button with a grid pattern could represent a view toggle; the third button with gear/cog could be for settings.

2. Left Column:
   - Dates column showing times of the day at intervals, starting from "00:00" at the top and ending with "22:00" at the bottom.

3. Center:
   - A large calendar interface with the days of the week at the top: MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, and SUN.
   - Below the days, rows of dates for the month of February 2024 are displayed, starting with "1" and ending with "29."
   - There are indications, such as circles, on certain dates, possibly representing events or appointments.

4. Right Side:
   - On the right edge of the interface, three circular buttons at different vertical positions, likely for navigation or adding new events.

5. Bottom:
   - A button at the bottom center of the calendar labeled "Go to Day," indicating a feature to jump to a selected day.

6. Center-Popup:
   - A smaller floating calendar within the center of the interface showing a month view with dates "1" to "29," and the same days of the week at the top as the larger calendar. This could be for selecting a specific day.
   - Left-pointing and right-pointing chevrons on either side of the month's name at the top, for navigating between months.
   - An 'X' on the top-right corner of the popup, likely to close the mini-calendar view.

Lastly, there's a plus (+) button seemingly floating over the interface towards the bottom right corner, typically used for adding a new event or entry into the calendar.
