The UI interface in the image appears to be from a desktop application and consists of the following elements:

1. At the top-left corner of the window, there is a set of three small, circular buttons, typically used for window management such as closing, minimizing, or expanding the window. Next to these, there is a rectangular button with an icon that represents window management options.

2. To the right of the rectangular button, there is a drop-down menu labeled "main 2."

3. At the top-right corner of the window, you can find a circular button, possibly for window settings or application-specific options.

4. Below the title bar, there is a horizontal toolbar or area that runs across the window. On the left side of this toolbar, there's a segment with four icons that are likely tools or functions related to the application's operations.

5. On the right side of the toolbar, there's a drop-down menu with a down-facing arrow and the label "All (Actions + Cleaners)."

6. Next to the drop-down menu, there is a search field with a magnifying glass icon indicating functionality to search within the application.

7. The main area of the UI is divided into two sectionsâ€”a narrower column on the left and a wider column on the right.

8. The narrower left column appears to be a sidebar with icons and labels, possibly representing different categories or views within the application.

9. The wider right column displays a list of items or actions. Each item in the list has a square icon to the left, which might indicate a status, category, or selection feature, followed by text labels. Examples of the labels visible are:
   - "Set Strikethrough"
   - "Set Script Attribute"
   - "Remove Character Attribute"
   
   And under the headings:
   - "GENERAL" with items such as "Group," "Define List," "Process List," "Note," and "Repeat."
   - "CORE" with items such as "Delete Text" and "Copy to Clipboard."

10. There is also a scrollbar on the right edge of the list, indicating that more items are available beyond what is currently visible.
