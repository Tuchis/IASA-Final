 The UI of the app includes a search bar at the top, a list of reminders below the search bar, and a set of buttons at the bottom of the screen.

The search bar has a magnifying glass icon on the left and a text field on the right. The text field is labeled "Search" and has a placeholder that says "Search".

Below the search bar is a list of reminders. Each reminder consists of a time, a title, and a play button. The time is displayed in a large font on the left side of the reminder. The title is displayed in a smaller font below the time. The play button is located on the right side of the reminder.

The buttons at the bottom of the screen are used to create new reminders. The first button is a plus sign. The second button is a clock. The third button is a notebook. The fourth button is a bell. The fifth button is a triangle with an exclamation mark.
