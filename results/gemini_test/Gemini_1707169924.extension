 The UI of the app is very simple. It consists of a large circle in the center of the screen with a plus sign in it. The circle is surrounded by a light gray border. The word "Gemini" is written in the top left corner of the screen. The text "Add or Drop Folders" is written in the center of the screen, below the circle.
