 The UI of the app has a clean and modern design. The main window is divided into three sections. The left section contains the app's logo and a search bar. The middle section displays a grid of icons. The right section contains three buttons: "Browse, search & preview", "Drag & Drop", and "Export icons with ease".

The app's logo is a simple illustration of a jar with a magnifying glass inside it. The search bar is located below the logo and allows users to search for icons by name or keyword.

The grid of icons in the middle section displays all of the icons that are currently installed on the user's computer. The icons are arranged in alphabetical order by name.

The three buttons in the right section of the window allow users to browse, search, and export icons. The "Browse, search & preview" button opens a new window where users can browse through all of the icons that are installed on their computer. The "Drag & Drop" button allows users to drag and drop icons from the Finder into the app. The "Export icons with ease" button allows users to export icons in a variety of formats, including PNG, SVG, and ICO.

The app also has a number of other features, including the ability to create custom icon sets, share icons with other users, and import icons from other apps.
