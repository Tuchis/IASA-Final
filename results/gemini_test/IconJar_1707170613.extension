 The UI is divided into two main sections. The left section has a sidebar with three items: "All Icons", "Starred", and "Your Icon Sets". The right section is where the icons are displayed.

The "All Icons" section has a search bar at the top and a list of icon sets below. The icon sets are organized into categories, such as "Material Design Icons", "Font Awesome", and "Custom Icons".

The "Starred" section shows the icon sets that have been starred by the user.

The "Your Icon Sets" section shows the icon sets that have been created by the user.

The right section of the UI is where the icons are displayed. The icons are displayed in a grid format, and the user can scroll through the icons to see them all.

At the bottom of the right section, there is a slider that can be used to adjust the size of the icons.

There is a button at the top right corner that says "Export .iconJar".
