 The UI of the app is divided into two parts. The left part is a mockup of a smartphone with a photorealistic shadow. The right part is a color palette.

In the color palette, there are three sections. The first section is "Photorealistic". It contains a set of predefined color schemes that are designed to look realistic. The second section is "Clay". It contains a set of predefined color schemes that are designed to look like clay. The third section is "Custom Color". It allows you to create your own custom color scheme.

In the "Photorealistic" section, there are 10 color schemes. Each color scheme consists of a set of colors that are used for the different elements of the UI. For example, one color scheme might use a light blue for the background, a darker blue for the buttons, and a white for the text.

In the "Clay" section, there are 10 color schemes. Each color scheme consists of a set of colors that are used for the different elements of the UI. For example, one color scheme might use a light brown for the background, a darker brown for the buttons, and a white for the text.

In the "Custom Color" section, you can create your own custom color scheme. You can do this by selecting a color from the color wheel or by entering a hex value. You can also adjust the opacity of the color.

Once you have created a custom color scheme, you can apply it to the mockup of the smartphone. To do this, simply click on the "Apply" button.
