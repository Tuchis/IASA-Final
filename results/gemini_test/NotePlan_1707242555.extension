 The UI of the app has a sidebar on the left and a content area on the right.

The sidebar contains a list of items, each of which represents a different section of the app. The items are:

- Calendars
- Markdown
- Todo
- Editor
- Themes
- AI & Plugins
- Sync
- Shortcuts
- Files
- License

The content area displays the contents of the selected section. For example, if the "Calendars" section is selected, the content area will display a list of calendars.

The app also has a number of buttons and text fields. The buttons are used to perform actions, such as creating a new calendar or opening a file. The text fields are used to enter data, such as the name of a new calendar or the text of a new note.
