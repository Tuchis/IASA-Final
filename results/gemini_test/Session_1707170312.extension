 The UI is divided into two parts. The left part has a clock with a red needle. The clock is surrounded by a pink circle. Below the clock, there is a red button that says "START SESSION". The right part has a calendar. The calendar shows the current month and the days of the week. The days of the week are abbreviated as MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, and SUN. The current day is highlighted in red. Below the calendar, there is a plus sign (+) button.
