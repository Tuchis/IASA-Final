 The UI of the app is divided into three main sections: the left sidebar, the top bar, and the main content area.

The left sidebar contains a list of items, which in this case are the different categories of apps. The top bar contains the search bar, the install button, and the profile picture of the current user. The main content area contains a list of apps, which in this case are the apps that are in the selected category.

The main content area also contains a button that says "Install All", which will install all of the apps in the current category. The apps in the main content area are arranged in a grid, with each app having its own icon, name, and description. The apps also have a rating, which is displayed in stars.

The UI of the app is simple and easy to use. The left sidebar allows the user to quickly navigate to the different categories of apps, and the top bar allows the user to search for apps or install all of the apps in the current category. The main content area displays the apps in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for the user to find the apps that they are looking for.
