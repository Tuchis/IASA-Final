 The UI is divided into two parts. The left part has a sidebar with 5 items:
* General
* Windows
* Snapping
* Apps
* Menubar
* Advanced
* About

The right part has the content area. In the screenshot, the content area is showing the settings for the "Apps" section. The content area has a title "Apps" and a description "Control running applications by swiping and pinching on their dock icon."

Below the description, there is a section called "Application Menu". It has a checkbox "You can also invoke gestures on the app's menu, right next to the ï£¿ symbol."

Below the "Application Menu" section, there is a section called "General Modifier". It has a label "Tap and hold to activate and chain an app's frontmost window. This allows you to apply any window gesture afterwards." and a modifier key icon.

Below the "General Modifier" section, there is a section called "Secondary Modifier". It has a label "Swipe up to activate and chain windows of an app in forward or backward order." and a modifier key icon.

Below the "Secondary Modifier" section, there is a list of 6 actions:

* Activate
* Cycle
* Quit
* Minimize
* Unminimize
* Hide

Each action has a label and a shortcut. The shortcuts are modifier keys or combinations of modifier keys.
