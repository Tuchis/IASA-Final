 The UI is divided into 2 parts. Left part is for displaying the actions and right part is for displaying the text. Left part has a search bar at the top. Below the search bar, there is a list of items. Each item has a checkbox, a label, and 3 buttons. The buttons are for setting strikethrough, setting script attribute, and removing character attribute. Right part has a title "main 2" at the top. Below the title, there is a large empty area.
