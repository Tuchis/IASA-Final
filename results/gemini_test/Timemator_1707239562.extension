 The UI interface of the app has a title "Accessibility API Access". Below the title, there is a message explaining why the app needs permission to use the Mac's Accessibility system. It also provides three steps to activate it.

The three steps are:
1. Open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy.
2. Click the Privacy tab and select Accessibility from the list.
3. Click the lock icon to make changes and check the box next to Timemator.

Below the steps, there are two buttons: "Back" and "Open System Preferences".
