4. Main Content Area (Right Panel):
   - **Section Title**: In bold, it says "Work".
   - **Feature Highlights**:
     - Upper left: "APPS WE LOVE" banner with the text "Get more done with Things" and "The app makes it simple to organise and prioritise."
     - Upper right: "GET IT DONE" section with a title "Tidy up your Mac" and a subtitle "Clear out the cruff with these handy apps."
     - Both feature highlight sections include stylized graphics that represent work and organization.

5. App Suggestions Section:
   - **Section Headline**: "Great New Productivity Apps and Updates" with a "See All" link on the far right.
   - **First Row of Apps**:
     - "BBEdit": An icon with 'B' symbol, described as a "Legendary text and code editor", with a blue "Get" button implying it's free with the label "In-App Purchases".
     - "ScreenFloat - Screenshot Tools": An icon showing a camera, described as "Power up your Screenshots" with a price tag "£14.99" and also marked with "In-App Purchases".
     - "Essayist - APA, MLA & More": A book-like icon, labeled "The Academic Writing App" with a blue "Get" button indicating it is free or downloadable.
     - "Planny • Daily Planner": An icon with a smiling checklist, subtitled "To do list, Focus, Teamwork," again with a blue "Get" button and "In-App Purchases" label.

This interface is designed to present a selection of productivity applications tailored for work with easy navigation on the left and featured applications in the main panel. The use of color (e.g., blue for 'Get' buttons), icons, and succinct text descriptions helps users quickly understand the purpose and cost associated with each app. The feature highlights on the top suggest editorial picks or themes the store is promoting.
