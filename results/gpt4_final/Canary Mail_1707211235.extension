The UI interface of the app presented in the image is designed for adding an account, presumably to some sort of software or service. Here's a detailed description of each UI element visible in the image:

1. **Top Navigation Bar**:
   - **Back Button**: Located in the top left corner, it's labeled "Back" and is meant to allow users to return to the previous screen.
   - **Status Message**: Right-aligned near the top, there's a message stating, "Please enter a valid email address", which likely indicates that the current entry in the email field is invalid or incomplete.

2. **Main Title**:
   - **Title Text**: The words "Add Account" are prominently displayed in a large, bold font in the upper half of the screen, serving as the title or main action of this interface.

3. **Email Input Field**:
   - **Text Field**: There is an editable text field with the partial text "yelyzaveta." entered, suggesting the user has begun to type an email address but has not yet completed it.
   - **Field Outline**: The text field has a standard rectangular box outline, indicating where users should click or tap to enter their email address.

4. **Action Button**:
   - **Sign In Button**: Positioned beneath the email input field, there is a blue, rounded-corner button labeled "Sign In", which is likely used to submit the entered email address and proceed with the sign-in or account addition process.

5. **Background**:
   - The background of the screen is white, which helps in making the text and other elements stand out clearly.

Overall, the UI is minimalist with a focus on functionality, intended to guide users smoothly through the process of adding an account by entering their email address and then signing in. The presence of a message about entering a valid email address serves as instantaneous feedback to the user to correct the input if necessary.
