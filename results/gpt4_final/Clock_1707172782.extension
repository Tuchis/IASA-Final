The image shows a user interface for a timer application on a computer, possibly part of a clock or time management software. Here are the elements of the UI in detail:

1. Window Control Buttons: In the top-left corner, there are three circular buttons typically found on macOS user interfaces: red, yellow, and green, which are used for closing, minimizing, and maximizing the window, respectively.

2. Top Bar Tabs: At the top of the window, there are four tabs indicating different functions of the application which are "World Clock", "Alarms", "Stopwatch", and "Timers". The "Timers" tab is highlighted, suggesting that it is currently selected.

3. Timer Display: The central large display shows the timer set to "00:15:00", which represents hours, minutes, and seconds. This suggests the timer is set for 15 minutes.

4. Time Adjustment Labels: Above the main timer display are three labels for the time components "hr" for hours, "min" for minutes, and "sec" for seconds, aligned from left to right, corresponding to the timer setting below them.

5. Timer and Sound Selection Area:
   - Timer Label: There's a label "Timer" indicating the type of countdown timer.
   - Sound Label: Next to it is a label "Apex" with a drop-down arrow on the right, which likely indicates the current selected alarm or notification sound.
   - Sound Preview Button: To the right, there's a circular button with a play icon (triangle), probably used to preview the selected sound.

6. Control Buttons:
   - Cancel Button: A rectangular button labeled "Cancel" on the bottom left, which seems to be for canceling or clearing the current timer.
   - Start Button: A rectangular button colored in green and labeled "Start" on the bottom right. This is likely used to begin the timer countdown.

7. Add Timer Button: In the top right of the window, there is a "+" button which is typically used to add a new timer.

The background of the application is dark, which suggests the interface might be utilizing a dark mode theme. Given the layout and design, the app appears to be designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind.
