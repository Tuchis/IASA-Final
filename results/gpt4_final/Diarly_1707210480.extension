The image displays a welcome screen for a mobile application named "Diarly." The user interface consists of the following elements:

1. Title/Header Text: At the top of the screen, centered, is the title text that reads, "Welcome to Diarly".

2. Subtitle Text: Below the title, still centered, is the subtitle text which describes the app with the words, "Secure, simple & beautiful diary app."

3. Illustration: Dominating the central portion of the screen is an illustration of a person sitting cross-legged while using a tablet device. The person appears relaxed and focused on the screen of the device. To the right of the person is a potted plant, and to the left, there is a small cup, possibly a coffee cup, placed on the ground.

4. Skip Button: In the lower-left corner of the screen, there is a button labeled "Skip". It is styled with a light or muted color, suggesting it is a secondary action.

5. Get Started Button: On the bottom right, there's a button labeled "Get Started" with a contrasting and more vibrant color, suggesting it is the primary call to action.

The overall UI design is minimalistic, with a focus on welcoming users to the new app and nudging them to start using the app by tapping "Get Started," or opting to skip this welcome screen, potentially to sign in or sign up, with the "Skip" button.
