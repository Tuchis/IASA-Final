The user interface in the image provided appears to be from a desktop application, potentially for project management or content creation, considering the options available. Here’s a detailed description of each visible UI element:

1. Window Controls: At the top left corner, there are three window control buttons typical for macOS applications: red (close), yellow (minimize), and green (full-screen).

2. Sidebar Menu: On the left side of the window, there is a sidebar menu with the following options:
   - "New Project" with an icon that resembles a file with a plus sign.
   - "Recent" with an icon that suggests recently accessed files.
   - "Learn to Play" with an icon that indicates an educational feature or tutorial.
   - "Lesson Store" with an icon representing a shopping feature for lessons.
   - "Project Templates" with an icon suggesting predefined project formats.

3. Main Content Area: The larger panel on the right is divided into a few sections:
   - A header at the top with the title "Choose a Project."
   - In the main content section, a prominent representation of a project with the label "Empty Project" is shown as a selectable option. The icon appears like a collection of horizontal lines with a plus symbol, indicating the ability to start a new project from scratch.
   - Below the "Empty Project" graphic, there’s text that reads "Create an empty project."
   - At the bottom of this section, there is a clickable link or button that states "Open an existing project..."

4. Bottom Bar: At the bottom of the main content area, there is a button labeled "Choose" with a blue background, suggesting it’s the primary action for the user to confirm their selection.

Note that the UI elements are designed in a minimalist style, with plenty of white space and a clean layout. This view seems to be focused on opening or starting a project, with the left sidebar allowing for navigation between different application functionalities and the main area dedicated to project selection and creation.
