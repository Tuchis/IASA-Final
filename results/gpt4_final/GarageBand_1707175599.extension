The image displays a user interface of what appears to be a music production or sound editing application. The interface is divided into two main sections: a sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right.

Starting with the sidebar on the left, there are multiple options each with an icon and a label:

1. New Project: This option has an icon resembling a document with a star or burst symbol, suggesting the creation of a new project.
2. Recent: The icon for this option looks like a clock face, denoting recent documents or projects.
3. Learn to Play: This icon has a musical note and a graduation cap, which implies tutorials or educational content related to music.
4. Lesson Store: Next to the store icon, which includes a shopping bag, this likely provides access to additional lessons or content that can be purchased.
5. Project Templates: Indicated by a layout icon, it signifies pre-designed music project templates that can be used to start new projects.

Next to the sidebar, there's an expandable menu labeled "Details" and beneath that, there's a clickable link or button that says "Open an existing project...", suggesting an option to open projects that are not listed in the "Recent" section.

In the main content area, the heading "Choose a Project" is displayed, signifying that this area is for selecting the type of new project to start. There are five project types to choose from, represented by visually distinct buttons:

1. Keyboard Collection: Highlighted in blue and showing an image of piano keys, this button is likely selected by default or recommended. The title beneath it says "A diverse collection of keyboards and synthesizers", indicating this project type includes various keyboard sounds.
2. Amp Collection: Showing an image of an electric guitar with an amplifier, suggesting projects centered around guitar amplification.
3. Voice: This has a microphone symbol, likely indicating a project template for vocal recording.
4. Electronic: The image appears to be a waveform or MIDI interface, which might be focused on electronic music production.
5. Songwriter: The icon includes an acoustic guitar and musical notes, implying a template for songwriting.
6. Hip-Hop: With a drum machine pad icon, it suggests a focus on creating hip-hop beats or tracks.

At the bottom of the main content area, there is a "Choose" button on the right, which is probably used to confirm the selection of the highlighted project type, and then proceed to the next step in the application.

Lastly, at the top left corner of the window, there are the three standard window control buttons typically found on a macOS interface: red, yellow, and green, which are used to close, minimize, and maximize the window, respectively.
