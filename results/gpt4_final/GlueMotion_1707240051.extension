The image appears to display a user interface (UI) of a photo or video editing application focused on color adjustments. Here is a detailed description of the UI elements visible in the image:

Top Left Corner:
- "< Go Back" button: A navigational control likely to return to a previous screen or menu.

Top Middle Section:
- Tabs/Buttons for different editing features: "Frames," "Transforms," "Adjustments," "Blending," "Speed," "Export." These are likely options to switch between various editing modes or settings within the application.

Right Panel:
- Title: "Adjust Colors": This indicates that this section of the UI deals with color adjustment settings.
- Subtitle: "Adjust colors using keyframes": Suggests that the settings will apply to keyframes for animating changes over time.
- A list of collapsible menus for different adjustment parameters:
    - White Balance
    - Motion
    - Noise Reduction
    - Color Controls
    - Light Correction
    - Exposure Correction
    - Gamma Correction
    - Hue Correction
    - Sepia Tone
Each of these adjustment options has an accompanying slider indicated by a circle, which users can likely drag left or right to adjust the intensity or value of the setting. Next to each slider are two icons: a clock, possibly indicating that the setting can be animated over time with keyframes, and a reset icon (a circular arrow), which would typically reset the setting to its default value.

Bottom Left Corner:
- Playback controls: Four icons likely represent "Skip Backward," "Play/Pause," "Stop," and "Skip Forward" functionality. There's also a counter "1/2" which implies that the user is viewing the first of two items, be they images or video frames.

Bottom Center:
- A timeline slider with an indication of playhead position: This suggests that the user can scrub through the edited media.

Bottom Right Corner:
- "More" dropdown menu: This might give additional options related to the editing process.
- "Continue" button: A call to action to proceed with the next step, possibly to apply the adjustments and move forward in the editing workflow.

Top Right Corner:
- A user account or profile icon: Indicating access to user account settings or information.
- A help or information icon: Typically used to access support, tutorials, or FAQ.

Throughout the UI, the color palette is dark, often preferred for photo and video editing applications to minimize distraction and make color adjustments easier to perceive accurately. The UI seems to be well organized, grouping related controls together and using sliders for granular control, which is typical of advanced editing software. The image in the background of the UI is of illuminated hanging lanterns, likely a photo that is currently being edited and acted upon by the adjustment settings visible in the interface.
