The image displays a promotional or instructional UI interface for an application called IconJar. The UI is divided into a main panel on the left and three feature descriptions on the right, each with an accompanying icon. Below is a detailed breakdown of each UI element:

Left Panel:
1. At the top-left corner, there are three dots representing a pagination or image carousel indicator. There are three dots in total, implying there may be three slides or pages to view.
2. Below the dots, there is an application icon that is a combination of a jar with a magnifying glass encompassing it, suggesting the function of the app is related to icon management and search.
3. Next to the application icon, there is a text heading in bold: "Welcome to IconJar."
4. Under the heading, there is a tagline in a smaller font size: "Store all your icons in one place, just a click away."
5. At the bottom-left corner, there are two social media icons for Facebook and Twitter, which are likely clickable and would direct the user to the respective social media pages of the application.

Right Panel (Feature Descriptions):
Each feature has an icon followed by a title and description.

6. Browse, search & preview (represented by a magnifying glass icon):
   - Title: "Browse, search & preview"
   - Description: "Just hit the spacebar and preview any icon at any size using our custom Quicklook."

7. Export icons with ease (represented by an export or share icon):
   - Title: "Export icons with ease"
   - Description: "Just select the icons you want, pick any sizes, click export and we'll handle the rest."

8. Drag & Drop (represented by a cursor icon):
   - Title: "Drag & Drop"
   - Description: "It even works in with apps that donâ€™t support SVGs when you use our QuickDrag feature."

9. Optimised for the Mac (represented by a smiling Mac computer icon):
   - Title: "Optimised for the Mac"
   - Description: "Unrivalled native performance, nothing even comes close to our responsiveness."

At the bottom of the Right Panel:
10. There is a primary action button labeled "Get Started," which is presumably intended for new users to begin using the application or to download it.

The overall design uses a clean and minimalistic approach with predominantly white space, light shadows behind the buttons and icons, green color accents, and clear typography to explain the application's features.
