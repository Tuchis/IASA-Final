The image shows a user interface for a software application called "Merlin Project Express." Here is a detailed breakdown of the UI elements:

- On the top-left corner, there's a vertical navigation menu with icons. From top to bottom, the menu items are:
  
  1. "New Document" - represented by a piece of paper with a "+" symbol.
  2. "Recent Documents" - symbolized by a clock face.
  3. "Help & Instructions" - indicated by a question mark.
  4. "Own Templates" - represented by a square with a folded corner.

- In the center and right portion of the window, several document templates are displayed as selectable options, each with its own icon and label:
  
  1. "Empty Document" - an icon of a blank document.
  2. "Demo Document" - an icon featuring a presentation screen.
  3. "Big birthday" - an icon with balloons.
  4. "Online advertising campaign" - an icon with code brackets, symbolizing a programmatic aspect.
  5. "Road trip" - an icon with a road and dollar sign, implying budgeting or planning for a trip.
  6. "Simple activity plan" - an icon resembling a bulleted list.
  7. "Start of self employment" - an icon with a rocket ship, representing a startup or business launch.
  8. "Wedding" - an icon with a heart enclosed in a ring, denoting wedding planning.

Below these icons, the category label "Templates" can be seen, categorizing these document templates.

- At the bottom of the window, there are three buttons:

  1. "Open existing document..." - a button on the left side that suggests the ability to open a document previously created or saved.
  2. "Cancel" - a button on the bottom-right that likely closes the dialog or cancels the action of creating a new document.
  3. "Create" - a button next to "Cancel" with a blue background, which is presumably used to create a new document from the selected template.

- At the very top of the window, the window control buttons (red, yellow, and green) for a macOS application are visible, indicating that this software is running on a Mac.

- In the top-middle of the window, the title "Merlin Project Express" is displayed, providing the name of the application.

This UI is designed for a user to easily start a new project with various pre-defined templates or create a new document from scratch. The template selections suggest that the application could be used for project management or planning across different event types and tasks.
