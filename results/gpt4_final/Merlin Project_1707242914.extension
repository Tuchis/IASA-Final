The provided image showcases the user interface of a project management application with a focus on planning and scheduling. The UI is split into three principal areas: the task list on the left, the Gantt chart in the middle, and the settings or details panel on the right.

Left Panel (Task List):
- The top bar includes traffic light control buttons (close, minimize, maximize), a search input field, and a few unidentified icons for additional functionalities.
- The task list is named "Work Breakdown" and it outlines tasks under the project titled "Big birthday".
- Each task or group of tasks has columns for "#," "Traits," "Title," "Given Work," "Earliest Start," and "Resources."
- The list consists of multiple tasks such as "Set date," "Preparation," "Guest list," "Location," "Invitation," "Catering," and "Overnight accommodation."
- Each task has subtasks, for example, "Guest list" contains "Create guest list," and "Location" has subtasks like "Make location inquiries and compare," "Negotiate terms," and "Book location."
- Some tasks have indented subtasks, depicting a hierarchy and the breakdown of tasks into smaller components.
- There's a timeline on the left indicating the task has a scheduled start date, for example, "Big birthday" is scheduled to start on "7 Feb 2024."
- Resources associated with each task or subtask are listed, such as "Person celebrating the birthday," "Friend with design expertise," "Printer," and "Partner of person celebrating the birthday."

Middle Panel (Gantt Chart):
- The Gantt chart visually represents the project timeline and task durations from "WK 6, 5 February" through "WK 17, 28 April" with subdivisions showing individual dates.
- Each task from the task list is represented as a bar on the timeline.
- The bars are connected with arrows indicating dependencies or the sequence in which tasks should be completed.
- Some tasks have call-out boxes with text, likely identifying the task, such as "Person celebrating big birthday."

Right Panel (Settings/Details):
- The panel is titled "Big birthday: General" and has buttons for calendar view, print, and other unidentified functionalities.
- The settings in this panel have various collapsible sections, including "Date Presets," "Work & Duration," "Default Values," and "Resources."
- "Date Presets" contain fields for "Direction" (set to Forward), "Start" (listing "7 Feb 2024 at 00:00"), and "First day of week" (set to Monday).
- "Work & Duration" includes fields for "Hours per day" (set to 8), "Hours per week" (set to 40), "Days per month" (set to 20), and "Calculation Unit" (set to Dynamically).
- "Default Values" has fields for "Work" (set to "1 day?") and "Duration."
- "Status Date" shows "6 Feb 2024 at 19:08" and "Actual Start/End" set to Automatic.
- "Resources" indicates a "Currency Symbol" with pound sterling selected (Â£1).
