The image depicts a user interface (UI) of a feed reader or content aggregator application with multiple panels and elements:

**Left Panel:**
- At the very top, there are three round buttons with colors red, yellow, and green, resembling the standard window control buttons for close, minimize, and maximize on macOS.
- Below the window control buttons, there is a segment with "Smart Filters" and icons indicating categories such as "Latest News" with a circle containing the number 1, "Unread Items" with a circle containing the number 99, and "Favorites" with a star icon.
- In the "Subscriptions" segment, there are multiple items with various icons representing different sources, including:
  - GE symbolizing General Electric with the label "\"machine learning\" - Google News" and a circle with the number 27,
  - An orange icon with "Blog" and the number 4,
  - Multiple other sources all related to Machine Learning, each with its corresponding icon and unread count such as "9" or "24."
- At the bottom of the left panel, there are three buttons – a plus sign, a box with lines (presumably an organize or sort button), and a star.

**Central Panel:**
- A header bar with the text "Machine Learning Blog | ML@..." followed by a minimized URL or email and an expand/collapse icon.
- Below the header, there's an item preview with the following attributes:
  - A thumbnail with a chart-like image,
  - A title: "On Noisy Evaluation in Federated Hyperparameter Tuning,"
  - A brief snippet of an article: "Evaluating models in federated networks is challenging due to factors such as client subsamp... Machine Learn... 29/12/2023, 18:04"
  - On the right side of this header bar, there’s a vertical ellipsis indicating a menu or additional options.

**Right Panel:**
- A header with three icons: a bookmark or tag, a square with an arrow pointing up (share button), and a magnifying glass (search icon).
- Further down is the title of the selected article: "On Noisy Evaluation in Federated Hyperparameter Tuning" with the article's metadata: "Machine Learning Blog | ML@CMU | Carnegie Mellon University – Kevin Kuo" and the date "Friday, 29 December 2023, 18:04".
- The main content area of the right panel shows a figure or diagram related to the article. The figure shows various configurations of a process, a "Client pool," and has arrows connecting these configurations to an "Evaluation sample" column. This column has representations of three samples, two marked with a red "X" and the third leading to a "Server" graphic, which then leads to an "Aggregated ranking" graph.
- Below the figure, there is excerpted text from the article: "Evaluating models in federated networks is challenging due to factors such as client subsampling, data heterogeneity, and privacy. These factors introduce noise that can affect hyperparameter tuning algorithms and lead to suboptimal model selection."
