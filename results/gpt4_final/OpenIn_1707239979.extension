This image shows the user interface of the "OpenIn Settings" application on a computer with a presumably macOS-inspired design.

In the window's top-left corner, there are three colored buttons typically used to control the window state: red (close), yellow (minimize), and green (full-screen or maximize).

At the top of the window, to the right of these control buttons, is the application's name, "OpenIn Settings," next to a gear icon, indicating settings or configuration.

Below the application name and icon are six tabs:
1. General (currently selected) - Represented by a slider icon.
2. Browsers - With an icon resembling a globe or compass.
3. Mail apps - Displayed with an envelope icon.
4. Call apps - Signified by a phone icon.
5. Files - Marked with a folder icon.
6. Backups - Indicated with a Time Machine-like icon suggesting backup functionality.
7. About - Represented by an information ("i") icon.

To the left of the main content area, there is a sidebar with two categories:
1. Groups - With an action button labeled "Add group..." accompanied by a plus sign within a folder, indicating an option to create a new group of settings.
2. File types - Similarly, there's a button labeled "Add file type..." with a plus sign next to a document icon, suggesting you can associate file types with specific applications or settings.

In the central part of the interface is a message that reads: "Select file handlers from the sidebar or create a new one," which implies user guidance on how to interact with the application's features.

Beneanath the message, two buttons replicate the sidebar's functionality:
1. A button labeled "Add group..." with an accompanying icon illustrating a folder with a plus sign.
2. A button labeled "Add file type..." with a document icon also featuring a plus.

The overall aesthetic is minimalistic, with a light theme, and uses standard macOS interface design elements like sidebar and segmented control tabs for navigation. The UI suggests that the application is used for setting default applications or handlers for various file types or protocols, organized into customizable groups.
