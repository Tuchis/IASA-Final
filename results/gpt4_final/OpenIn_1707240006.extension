This is an image of an application's settings interface, specifically the "About" section. At the top of the window, there is a series of icons arranged horizontally which seem to represent different settings categories:

1. **General** - represented by a cogwheel icon.
2. **Browsers** - represented by a globe or compass icon indicative of web browsers.
3. **Mail apps** - an icon that appears to be an envelope.
4. **Call apps** - an icon resembling a telephone.
5. **Files** - an icon that most likely represents file management or file associations.
6. **Backups** - symbolized by what seems to be a safe or a hard drive, indicative of backup settings.
7. **About** - indicated by an "i" inside a circle, commonly understood as "information."

In the "About" section of the settings, the following content is displayed:

- A greeting and introduction by Denis Gladkikh, who identifies himself as the author of OpenIn and describes the purpose of the app: to organize applications he uses daily and to share this with others.
- Denis emphasizes that he is an independent developer and that the application is not built by a large IT corporation. He mentions the benefit for users to contact him directly for support.
- He explains that he built the app, knows how to use it, can offer configuration guidance, and fix bugs.
- For further inquiries about the app, he refers to a FAQ section on the OpenIn website, providing a link: loshadki.app/openin/4
- Denis provides paths to start a discussion or ask questions via a subreddit: r/openin or by sending him an email at support@loshadki.app
- A call to action for suggestions on improving the application through email.
- An invitation to subscribe to a newsletter for staying in touch, learning about new versions, or participating in beta tests. This includes an assurance of privacy and no sharing of emails.

At the bottom, there is a button labeled "Export logs..." which suggests that users can export some form of logs from the application for debugging or informational purposes.
