   - A search field with a magnifying glass icon – to search through the application or content.
   - An "AI Assistant" button – suggests an AI or automated feature within the app to help the user.

2. **Left Sidebar Navigation:**

   - "Favorites" with a heart icon – shows the section currently being viewed.
   - "On This Mac" – likely a location/file manager for the local machine.

3. **Main Content Area – Favorites:**
   - The heading "Favorites" suggests the apps displayed are marked as favorites by the user.

     - "Pick colors for your designs" with the app name "Sip" and a heart icon.
   - App compatibility or device type (all listed as 'Mac' and 'Session' is also compatible with 'iOS').
   - Likability or satisfaction percentage (100% for PixelSnap, 98% for both CleanMyMac X and Session, and 94% for Sip).

4. **Bottom of Main Content Area:**
   - A placeholder icon suggesting there might be additional content or apps to be added with the text "Save time with a file manager".

5. **Top Right Controls:**
   - "Install all" button – presumably allows the user to install all listed favorite applications at once.
