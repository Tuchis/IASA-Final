The image displays a user interface from a study or note-taking application named Studies, which seems to be designed for organizing study materials and notes. The window is showing a settings or preferences panel for note stacks within the application. Here's a detailed breakdown of the UI elements:

1. **Top Bar:**
   - **Stack Management Buttons:** From left to right, "New Stack," "New Note," "Study All Due," "Study Session," "Continue Session," "Info," and "Sync" buttons.
   - **Search Field:** A search input field labeled "Filter Notes" for searching through notes.

2. **Library Section (Left Sidebar):**
   - A section titled "LIBRARY" with categories such as "All Notes," "Due for Study," "Flagged," "Loose Notes," "Trash," and a "RECENT" section with lists like "Recently Studied," "Recently Correct," and "Last Import."
   - Below, there are items listed under a "STACKS" heading, indicating grouped or categorized notes, but the specific stack names are not visible.

3. **Title of Stack:**
   - A text input field with the label "Title of Stack:" which has the text "UI Representation" already entered.

4. **New Note Template:**
   - A dropdown menu labeled "New Note Template:" currently set to "Question and Answer."

5. **Limit on Due Notes:**
   - A dropdown menu labeled "Limit on Due Notes:" with the option "100 Notes" selected.

6. **Facet Display Time:**
   - A dropdown menu labeled "Facet Display Time:" with the chosen duration of "5 seconds."

7. **Created and Modified Information:**
   - Text displaying the creation date as "6 February 2024 at 19:04" and the modification date "6 February 2024 at 19:04."

8. **Include in Sync Checkbox:**
   - A checkbox marked "Include in sync" which is currently checked.

9. **Study Schedule Section:**
   - A subheading titled "Study Schedule" followed by various radio button options for study planning including:
       - "Do not schedule notes for study"
       - "Long-term learning (Spaced Repetition)"
       - "Target a deadline (e.g. Exam)"
       - "Short-term cramming (Leitner System)"
       - "Regular time intervals"
   - There is also an information icon (?) which likely provides more details or help regarding the Study Schedule options.

10. **Action Buttons:**
    - Two buttons are at the bottom of the window: "Cancel," which presumably closes the panel or discards changes, and "Save," which likely saves the settings made by the user.

This UI is designed to customize the way a stack of notes is handled within the application, allowing for personalized study methods and organizing the syncing of notes across devices.
