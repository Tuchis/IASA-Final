The image displays a user interface for what appears to be a sign-up page for an email-based course or service related to time tracking. The UI comprises of the following elements:

1. A header in bold font: "Track your time like a pro."
2. A subheader with more information: "Look out for the free email course over the next few days where you will learn how to save even more time with Timing."
3. An icon of an envelope, stylized and enlarged, centered below the text to visually represent the email course.
4. A text field with a placeholder email address of "yelyzaveta.boiarchuk@gmail.com." This indicates where a user is supposed to enter their own email address.
5. A privacy disclaimer in smaller font size below the email input field: "When you sign up, we need to store your email address, but we will never spam you." This is followed by a hyperlink "Learn More" for additional information.
6. A navigation button on the bottom left that reads "Back" to allow users to return to the previous screen.
7. Pagination or progress indicator dots centered at the bottom, with one dot filled in, suggesting this is one part of a multi-step process or form.
8. A primary call-to-action button on the bottom right that says "Send Me the Course," which is presumably used to submit the email address and enroll in the course or service.
9. A "Skip" hyperlink/text in the top right corner, which allows users to bypass the current step or dismiss the process.

This UI seems designed to be simple and straightforward, with visually distinct areas for text entry, navigation, and progression, encouraging users to sign up for an email course that offers time management tips or similar content.
