The image displayed is a screenshot of an image editing application called TouchRetouch. The UI elements are arranged in a manner typical of photo editing software, and they are as follows:

1. **Top Left Controls**
   - A 'hamburger' menu icon which likely opens up additional options or settings.
   - An 'OPEN' text button for possibly opening or importing new images to edit.
   - A 'fit to screen' icon button (fit inside brackets) which presumably fits the image within the workspace on the screen.
   - A percentage indicator showing the current zoom level, in this instance at 103%.
   - A ratio selector indicating the current aspect ratio of the image view, with a '1:1' icon visible.

2. **Top Center Tools**
   - 'OBJECT REMOVAL' tool selected, indicated by a darker background to suggest it is the active tool.
   - 'QUICK REPAIR', 'LINE REMOVAL', 'CLONE STAMP', and 'TONE & COLOR' tools â€“ these are additional tools for editing, but they are not currently selected.

3. **Top Right Controls**
   - 'CROP' tool, which is not selected, used for cropping the image.
   - 'COMPARE' button with an eye icon, possibly to compare the before and after states.
   - 'UNDO' and 'REDO' buttons for reversing or reapplying the last changes made.
   - 'HISTORY' button which might open a panel showing the history of edits.
   - 'EXPORT' button to save or share the edited image.

4. **Main Editing Area**
   - The main portion of the interface is occupied by the image being edited. The image itself features various items such as backpacks, containers of food, papers, military gear, and a dog lying on grass.

5. **Document Title**
   - At the top center of the interface, above the image, the document title is specified as "TouchRetouch - 1.png" which is the name of the file being edited.

The UI suggests that the application focuses on object and blemish removal from photos, providing users with a suite of tools to clean up and enhance their images. There are also availability options for more precise edits and adjustments with clone stamping and tonal corrections.
