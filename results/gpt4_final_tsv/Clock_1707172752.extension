This looks like a screenshot from an application designed for managing time, possibly an alarm clock or a clock app on a computer or tablet device. The app's interface is divided into several sections:

1. **Title Bar:**
   - Three circular buttons in the top-left corner, presumably for closing (red), minimizing (yellow), and expanding (green) the application window.
   - The title of the program is in the center of the title bar and reads "Alarms".

2. **Tab Bar:** 
   - Just below the title bar, there are four horizontally aligned, clickable tabs, with the titles "World Clock," "Alarms," "Stopwatch," and "Timers." The "Alarms" tab is highlighted, indicating that it is the currently active view.

3. **Alarm List Area:**
   - There are two visible alarm settings shown as boxes on the screen.
   - The first box on the left displays an alarm set for "08:35" with the following details:
     - Title: "Alarm"
     - Repeat: "Never"
     - Sound: "Daybreak"
     - Below these details is a toggle switch in the off position, suggesting this alarm is currently deactivated.
   - The second box on the right displays an alarm set for "11:30" with similar details:
     - Title: "Alarm"
     - Repeat: "Mon, Tue and Wed" indicating this alarm is set to repeat on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
     - Sound: "Daybreak"
     - Below these details, there is a toggle switch in the on position, indicating this alarm is currently activated.

4. **Add Button (+):**
   - In the top-right corner of the application, there is a "+" button, which is typically used to add a new alarm.

5. **Navigation Bar:**
   - The bottom of the interface features a navigation bar, possibly housing additional options or settings. However, this area is mostly empty and dark, so no specific buttons or text can be discerned.

The app is set against a dark background, facilitating easier viewing in low-light conditions or during nighttime usage, a context common for clock and alarm applications.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
