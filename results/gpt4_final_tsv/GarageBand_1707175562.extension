The user interface in the image provided appears to be from a desktop application, potentially for project management or content creation, considering the options available. Here’s a detailed description of each visible UI element:

1. Window Controls: At the top left corner, there are three window control buttons typical for macOS applications: red (close), yellow (minimize), and green (full-screen).

2. Sidebar Menu: On the left side of the window, there is a sidebar menu with the following options:
   - "New Project" with an icon that resembles a file with a plus sign.
   - "Recent" with an icon that suggests recently accessed files.
   - "Learn to Play" with an icon that indicates an educational feature or tutorial.
   - "Lesson Store" with an icon representing a shopping feature for lessons.
   - "Project Templates" with an icon suggesting predefined project formats.

3. Main Content Area: The larger panel on the right is divided into a few sections:
   - A header at the top with the title "Choose a Project."
   - In the main content section, a prominent representation of a project with the label "Empty Project" is shown as a selectable option. The icon appears like a collection of horizontal lines with a plus symbol, indicating the ability to start a new project from scratch.
   - Below the "Empty Project" graphic, there’s text that reads "Create an empty project."
   - At the bottom of this section, there is a clickable link or button that states "Open an existing project..."

4. Bottom Bar: At the bottom of the main content area, there is a button labeled "Choose" with a blue background, suggesting it’s the primary action for the user to confirm their selection.

Note that the UI elements are designed in a minimalist style, with plenty of white space and a clean layout. This view seems to be focused on opening or starting a project, with the left sidebar allowing for navigation between different application functionalities and the main area dedicated to project selection and creation.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
