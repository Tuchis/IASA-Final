The image shows a user interface of what appears to be an icon management application. The UI is divided into three main columns, and features various interactive elements:

**Leftmost Column**:
- At the top, there are three circular buttons that seem to be the common window control buttons for closing, minimizing, and expanding the window.
- Below these window controls, there are four vertical navigation options: All Icons, Starred, Recently Used, and Your Icon Sets (with "Material Design Icons" as a subset).
- The 'All Icons' option is highlighted, suggesting it is the currently selected view.
- There is an input field at the bottom with a placeholder text "Filter Icon Sets".

**Middle Column**:
- The header of this column displays the word "regular" and, beneath it, "Material Design Icons > maps", indicating the current category or selection of icons.
- Below the title, there's a vast whitespace, which is likely where icons would be displayed when selected or searched for.
- A search bar is present in the top right corner with a placeholder text "Find in All Sets", accompanied by a magnifying glass icon.

**Rightmost Column**:
- The top right corner features a bell icon, denoting notifications.
- Below the notifications icon, there are two tabs: "Icon Set" and "Selection", where "Selection" appears to be active but both have no visual content in this screenshot.
- There is a section below with input fields for "Multiple Names" and "Description", both of which are empty.
- A non-editable field labeled "No License" suggests where license information would be displayed if available.
- Below this, there is a section with details about the current selection:
  - "Icon Count: 7737 Icons"
  - "Import Date: 06 Feb 2024"
  - "File Size: 3,7 MB"
  - "Selection: 85 Sets"
- Finally, at the very bottom, there is a button labeled "Export | IconJar...", indicating a feature to export icons.

The UI appears clean and favors a minimalist design, utilizing a neutral color palette of grays and blues. Elements such as the search functionality and filters suggest the app is designed for organizing and finding icons easily.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
