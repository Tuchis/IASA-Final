The image displays a typing interface, presumably from a typing practice application. Here are the elements identified from top to bottom:

1. At the top, there are three statistics indicators from left to right:
    - The leftmost indicator shows typing speed with an icon resembling a speedometer and the text "0 char/min", indicating the current typing speed is 0 characters per minute.
    - The middle indicator shows typing accuracy with an icon of a target and "100%" next to it, suggesting that the current typing accuracy is perfect.
    - The rightmost indicator is related to typos, with a skull icon and "0 typos" indicating that no typing errors have been made.

2. Below the statistics, there is a dark text entry area displaying a sequence of English words to type. The words are repeated in varying orders and are as follows: "at tee e eat e tea tata tee at ate o tee tate too to ate tata too t toe to ate at tee tattoo e too t". The word "at" is highlighted, which likely indicates the starting point for typing.

3. Underneath the text entry area is a visual representation of a keyboard with letters and other typical keys found on a standard keyboard layout. The following keys are highlighted, suggesting which keys should be pressed next:
    - The 'A' key is currently activated, indicating the user should press it. It’s also connected by a line to the highlighted word "at" in the text box above.
    - The 'T' key is suggested as the next key to press, indicated by lighter highlighting and a line connecting it to the 'A' key.
    - The 'Command' key on the right side of the spacebar is also highlighted in blue, but its relevance to the immediate typing task is not clear.

4. At the bottom of the screen, there is a question mark icon on the left and a settings cogwheel icon on the right, likely providing access to help or settings options, respectively.

The UI elements suggest that the user is expected to type the words displayed in the text area by pressing the highlighted keys on the visual keyboard. The statistics at the top provide feedback on the user’s performance in terms of speed, accuracy, and typos while practicing typing.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
