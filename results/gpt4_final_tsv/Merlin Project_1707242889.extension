The UI interface presented in the image is for an application named "Merlin Project Express," which appears to be a project management tool. The UI is laid out as follows:

1. At the top left corner, there is an app icon, which is a stylized image of a wizard's hat within a rounded square. The hat appears to have some elements resembling project management symbols, such as arrows or flowcharts around it.

2. Next to the app icon, to the right, is the heading "Welcome to Merlin Project Express" in large, bold text.

3. Below the heading, there is a subheading "Project management with a bit of magic" which is in a smaller font and appears less emphasized.

4. In the top right corner, there is a button labeled "Get Started" which is designed to initiate the onboarding process or take the user to the next step in setting up their project management workspace.

5. In the main portion of the interface, four features are listed, each accompanied by an icon and brief descriptive text.

   - "Work Breakdown & Gantt Chart" - This feature, represented by a blue icon resembling a flowchart and Gantt chart, enables users to create the flow of tasks, determine durations and dependencies, and define milestones.
   
   - "Resources & Assignments" - Accompanied by an icon that looks like a person in front of a desk or screen, this feature allows the creation of a team and assignment of team members to tasks. It also optionally includes the calculation of labor costs per activity, phase, or entire project.
  
   - "Attachments" - The icon for this section is a paperclip, implying the attachment of files. The text indicates that users can attach any number of files and documents of any type to tasks or resources in their project.
  
   - "Styling" - Represented by a paintbrush icon, this feature suggests that users can mark activities and design them as they like, either individually or by rules set within the app.

6. At the bottom of the interface, there is a "Continue" button which is likely intended for the user to proceed after becoming acquainted with the app's features.

The UI design uses a clean and straightforward layout with a cohesive color scheme underlining key features, offering easy navigation to new users.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
