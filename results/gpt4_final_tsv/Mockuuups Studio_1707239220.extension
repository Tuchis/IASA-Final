The image shows the user interface of a design tool named "Mockuuups Studio," specifically focused on the "Edit Color" section. Here is a detailed description of each UI element:

1. Top-left corner: There's a back arrow button that likely takes the user to the previous screen or panel.
2. Top-center: There is a header with the name "Mockuuups Studio."
3. Top-right corner: There is a "Done" button which presumably saves the changes made and exits the color editing mode.
4. Below the header and to the left: There are three toggle buttons labelled "Device," "Color," and "Shadow." The "Color" button is currently active, indicating that the user is editing color options.
5. Below the header and to the right: An "Inspire Me" option marked with a star icon, suggesting it may provide inspiration or suggestions for color choices.
6. In the central section of the UI: A smartphone mockup is visible featuring a blue gradient screen, set against a checkered background, which denotes transparency in graphic design.
7. On the right side of the UI: A panel for color editing features is provided:
   - PHOTO-REALISTIC: Eight circular swatches under this heading offer different color tones typically for realistic shading. The third swatch is ringed in black, indicating it may be the currently selected color.
   - CLAY: Another eight circular swatches are displayed under this heading with more saturated colors compared to the PHOTO-REALISTIC section.
   - SHAPE: Eight more circular swatches appear under the heading SHAPE, suggesting colors specifically for shapes or features on the device mockup. There's also a "Custom Color" option beneath the PHOTO-REALISTIC and CLAY sections and under SHAPE, suggesting the ability to choose a color not listed in the presets.
8. Additionally, there might be more options and settings that are not visible in the current cropped view of the UI.

The user is likely able to customize the appearance of the device mockup through this interface, changing things like color and shadow to achieve the desired look for presentations or marketing materials. All colors have a dual light/dark circle icon, which suggests a toggle between light and dark variations of the chosen colors.
