The image displays a graphical user interface (GUI) of a calendar application. Here are the details of the different elements visible in the interface:

1. Top Left Corner: 
   - There are three horizontally-aligned rectangular icons. The first appears to be a menu or navigation icon, commonly known as the 'hamburger' icon. The second is an arrow pointing to the left, which typically suggests a 'back' function. The third one is a similar arrow pointing to the right, usually indicating a 'forward' function.
   - Above these icons, there's text displaying the current month and year, "February 2024".

2. Top Right Corner: 
   - Two icons aligned horizontally, both resembling gears or settings buttons. The first one includes several sliders, which might indicate some sort of adjustment or settings option. The second gear icon has a dotted pattern, suggesting a different settings or options menu.

3. Calendar View:
   - A smaller calendar view is visible in the center with the heading "February 2024" above it. The days of the week (MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN) are labeled at the top.
   - Below the days of the week, dates are arranged in a grid corresponding to the days. The current date is highlighted with a red circle which encloses the number "12".
   - At the bottom of this calendar view, there are arrows on the left and right which could be used to navigate between months.

4. Go to Day Button:
   - Below the smaller calendar, there is a rectangular button with rounded corners, labeled "Go to Day" with a pinkish-red color, suggesting an action that could be performed, like navigating to a specific day's details.

5. Time Column on the Left Side:
   - On the left side, next to the smaller calendar view, there are time increments displayed vertically starting from "08:00", then "12:00", "16:00", and "22:00", suggesting that this might be part of a day view in the calendar where events can be scheduled.

6. Bottom Right Corner:
   - A circular button with a plus sign in it, commonly recognized as a button to add a new event or item to the calendar.

7. Three Horizontal Lines at the Top Left and Right Corners, and Bottom Center:
   - These represent the iOS-style indicators for the user to close or minimize the current view/app, navigate back to the previous screen, or open up additional options.

Each element likely interacts with the others, providing functionality to navigate through the calendar, adjust settings, view specific days, and add new events. The UI elements are arranged in a clean, minimalist design, which is typical for modern calendar apps.
