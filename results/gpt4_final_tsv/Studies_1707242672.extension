The image displays a user interface from a study or note-taking application named Studies, which seems to be designed for organizing study materials and notes. The window is showing a settings or preferences panel for note stacks within the application. Here's a detailed breakdown of the UI elements:

1. **Top Bar:**
   - **Stack Management Buttons:** From left to right, "New Stack," "New Note," "Study All Due," "Study Session," "Continue Session," "Info," and "Sync" buttons.
   - **Search Field:** A search input field labeled "Filter Notes" for searching through notes.

2. **Library Section (Left Sidebar):**
   - A section titled "LIBRARY" with categories such as "All Notes," "Due for Study," "Flagged," "Loose Notes," "Trash," and a "RECENT" section with lists like "Recently Studied," "Recently Correct," and "Last Import."
   - Below, there are items listed under a "STACKS" heading, indicating grouped or categorized notes, but the specific stack names are not visible.

3. **Title of Stack:**
   - A text input field with the label "Title of Stack:" which has the text "UI Representation" already entered.

4. **New Note Template:**
   - A dropdown menu labeled "New Note Template:" currently set to "Question and Answer."

5. **Limit on Due Notes:**
   - A dropdown menu labeled "Limit on Due Notes:" with the option "100 Notes" selected.

6. **Facet Display Time:**
   - A dropdown menu labeled "Facet Display Time:" with the chosen duration of "5 seconds."

7. **Created and Modified Information:**
   - Text displaying the creation date as "6 February 2024 at 19:04" and the modification date "6 February 2024 at 19:04."

8. **Include in Sync Checkbox:**
   - A checkbox marked "Include in sync" which is currently checked.

9. **Study Schedule Section:**
   - A subheading titled "Study Schedule" followed by various radio button options for study planning including:
       - "Do not schedule notes for study"
       - "Long-term learning (Spaced Repetition)"
       - "Target a deadline (e.g. Exam)"
       - "Short-term cramming (Leitner System)"
       - "Regular time intervals"
   - There is also an information icon (?) which likely provides more details or help regarding the Study Schedule options.

10. **Action Buttons:**
    - Two buttons are at the bottom of the window: "Cancel," which presumably closes the panel or discards changes, and "Save," which likely saves the settings made by the user.

This UI is designed to customize the way a stack of notes is handled within the application, allowing for personalized study methods and organizing the syncing of notes across devices.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
