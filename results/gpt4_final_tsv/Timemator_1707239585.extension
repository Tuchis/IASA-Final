The UI interface of the app seems to be divided into two main panels with various UI elements:

Left Panel:

1. Menu Bar at the top - Contains three colored dots indicative of a Mac application window, red, yellow, and green from left to right, which are typically used for closing, minimizing, and maximizing the window respectively.

2. Navigation Menu - Below the menu bar, there is a vertical menu bar with three items:
    - Tracking (currently selected, indicated by the blue highlight): An icon with a play symbol inside what appears to be a document, suggesting it may be for starting or tracking time for activities or tasks.
    - Timeline: An icon suggesting a timeline or schedule that could allow users to view time tracked across a timeline.
    - Reports: An icon with bars that likely indicates a section for viewing reports or statistics related to time tracking.

3. Timer Area - At the bottom of the left panel is a large timer display showing "00:00:00", which suggests that it is ready to start timing. Next to it is a button or field with "No Task" suggesting that you can select or describe the task you are timing.

Right Panel:

1. Tabs - There are three tabs at the top: "All Tasks," "Recent," and "Archive." "All Tasks" is currently selected. These tabs suggest filtering options for tasks or activity records.

2. Dropdown/Settings Button - To the right of the tabs, there's a button with a "+" icon and a downward arrow which might be used to add new tasks or access additional settings or options.

3. Time Entries Section Heading - This is labeled as "Time Entries" with subtitle text "last 30 days," implying this section is for viewing recorded time entries from the past month.

4. No Data Message - A prominent message "No time entries found" indicating that no time-tracking records are available for the selected period.

5. Call to Action and Import Options:
    - A button or link with the text "Start timer" suggesting an action to begin timing.
    - A description beneath it which says, "to create the first task or import your existing data."
    - Below the description is a button labeled "Import data as CSV..." indicating an option to import data from a CSV file into the app.

6. Additional Button - At the bottom right of the right panel, there's a "+" icon followed by an icon resembling a light bulb or tips. This could potentially be for adding a new time entry manually or accessing help/tips.

The plus buttons (+) in both the left and right panels likely offer a function to add new items relevant to their context (e.g., tasks or time entries). The overall design and layout suggest a time-tracking application designed for task management and productivity analysis.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
