The UI interface in the image you've shared appears to be from a photo or video editing application. Here are the UI elements present:

1. Top Left: There's a "< Go Back" link indicating a navigation control to the previous screen.
2. Top Center: There are tab-like controls labeled "Frames", "Transforms", "Adjustments", "Blending", "Speed", and "Export" which presumably switch the interface to various editing tools or options.
3. Main Area (Left): This shows the content being edited; it seems to be a still image or a frame from a video.
4. Bottom Left: There are playback controls commonly associated with video editing. These include what appears to be a "backward step" button, "play/pause" button, "stop" button, "forward step" button, and a "loop" button. There is also a slider with a "1/2" label, indicating the current frame or page, and a timeline or progress bar below this.
5. Bottom Center: A "More" dropdown button can be seen. This typically would display additional options or settings when clicked.
6. Main Area (Right): A panel titled "Adjust Colors" with a description "Adjust colors using keyframes" below it; inside the panel, there are several collapsible sections each with a corresponding toggle switch. These sections are titled "White Balance", "Motion", "Noise Reduction", "Color Controls", "Light Correction", "Exposure Correction", "Gamma Correction", "Hue Correction", and "Sepia Tone". Each section has additional controls symbolized by icons (presumably for resetting or keyframing these adjustments), but specific functions are not labeled with text.
7. Bottom Right: There is a button labeled "Continue", presumably to save changes and go to the next step in the editing process.

Please note that without additional context such as tooltips or having used the app, the description of each button's function is speculative based on common UI patterns.
