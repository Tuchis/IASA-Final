The UI interface in the image seems to be from a settings panel of an application. Here's a description of each element seen:

1. At the top of the window, there are three round buttons typically used for closing, minimizing, and maximizing the window.

2. There is a menu panel on the left side, with multiple options listed vertically. Each option has an associated icon that represents the function or section:

   - Display
   - Dock
   - Effect
   - Finder
   - Keyboard
   - Mouse
   - Photos (Currently selected as indicated by the highlighting)
   - Screenshot
   - Script
   - Simulator
   - Status Menu
   - System
   - Utility

3. On the top-right, there is a search field with a magnifying glass icon and the placeholder text "Search".

4. In the main content area on the right, there is:

   - A header with the text "Stop Photos" and an emoji replicating a hand gesture.
   - Below the header, there is a description text "Stop Photos from opening automatically".
   - Beneath the description, there is an icon that seems to be related to the "Photos" option.
   - To the right of the icon and description, there is a toggle switch, which is currently in the off position.

These are all the UI elements that are visible within the screenshot.
