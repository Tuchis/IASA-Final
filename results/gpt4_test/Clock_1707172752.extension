This is an image of an alarm application interface. Here are the elements present in the UI:

1. **Top-Left Corner**: Three circular buttons typically representing window control actions (close, minimize, maximize).

2. **Top-Center**: Four tabs or sections - "World Clock," "Alarms," "Stopwatch," and "Timers."

3. **Top-Right Corner**: A plus sign button, which commonly indicates an option to add a new item or create a new entry.

4. **Center**: Two large rectangular blocks that appear to be individual alarm settings.

   - **First Block**:
      - Large numbers indicating the alarm time: "08:35."
      - Text below the time saying "Alarm."
      - Text below "Alarm" reading "Repeat: Never."
      - Text below "Repeat" reading "Sound: Daybreak."
      - At the bottom of the block, a toggle switch in the off position.

   - **Second Block**:
      - Large numbers indicating another alarm time: "11:30."
      - Text below the time saying "Alarm."
      - Text below "Alarm" reading "Repeat: Mon, Tue and Wed."
      - Text below "Repeat" reading "Sound: Daybreak."
      - At the bottom of the block, a toggle switch in the on position.

5. **Bottom of the screen**: A darker area that possibly serves as a status bar or a lower menu bar, without any visible icons or text.
