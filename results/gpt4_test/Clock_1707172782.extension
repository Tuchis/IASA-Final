In the image, there is a user interface for a timer application. At the top of the interface, there are four tabs: "World Clock," "Alarms," "Stopwatch," and "Timers". The currently selected tab is "Timers," as indicated by the underline beneath it, and there is a "+" button to the right of these tabs.

Below the tabs, centered on the screen, is a large digital clock display showing "00:15:00," with smaller labels "hr," "min," and "sec" above the corresponding sections of the time display.

Below the digital clock display, there is a horizontal slider control that is currently set to a position labeled "Timer" and another choice "Apex" to the right of it. To the right of the "Apex" label, there is a circular button with an icon that implies functionality related to sound or notification.

At the bottom of the screen, there are two buttons: on the left is a "Cancel" button, and on the right is a "Start" button. The "Start" button seems to be highlighted suggesting it is the primary action the user can take.
