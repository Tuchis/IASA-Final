The UI interface of the app includes several elements:

1. At the top-left, there is a hamburger menu icon, which indicates that there is a navigation drawer or menu which can be accessed by tapping on it.
2. Below the hamburger menu, there are three vertically aligned icons along the left side of the screen:
   - The first icon represents 'Reminders' – it appears visually similar to a bell with a check mark.
   - The second icon represents 'Timers' – it resembles a timer or stopwatch.
   - The third icon is labeled as 'Logbook' – it is shown as a book or notebook.
3. At the bottom-left, there's a warning or alert icon indicated by a triangle with an exclamation mark inside it.
4. Below the alert icon, there's another icon, a plus sign inside a circle, which commonly suggests an action to add or create a new item.

In the main content area:
5. At the top of the main content area, there's a search field with a magnifying glass icon which suggests functionality to search within the app.
6. Below the search field, there are three list items, each with a timer value, a label, and a play button:
   - The first item shows "00:04:00" with the label "Coffee steeping" and has a play button to the right.
   - The second item displays "00:20:00" with the label "Power nap" and shows a sleep-related icon (zzz) and a gear icon, accompanying the play button.
   - The third item is "01:00:00" with the text "Pick up laundry" alongside a play button.
   
Each play button icon suggests that you can start the timer by pressing the button. The interface presents a clean and organized way to manage timers for different tasks or reminders.
