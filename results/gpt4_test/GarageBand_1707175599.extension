In the image, there appears to be a user interface for an application that likely involves music production or sound editing, based on the context given by the icons and labels. Here's a breakdown of each visible UI element:

1. On the top left corner, there are three window control buttons which typically represent closing, minimizing, and expanding the window.

2. Below, on the left sidebar, there are multiple menu options:
   - "New Project"
   - "Recent"
   - "Learn to Play"
   - "Lesson Store"
   - "Project Templates"

3. Each menu item has an accompanying icon suggestive of its function next to the text.

4. Below the menu options, there's a drop-down toggle labeled "Details", which suggests expandability to show more options or information.

5. Underneath the "Details" toggle, there is a button or link labeled "Open an existing project..." which suggests functionality to load previously created projects.

6. In the main area to the right, the title "Choose a Project" is displayed at the top, indicating the purpose of the section.

7. Below the title, there are six square icons with labels underneath them, which seem to be different project templates or starting points:
   - The first project template is highlighted, labeled "Keyboard Collection"
   - Next to it is "Amp Collection"
   - Followed by "Voice"
   - On the second row, there's "Electronic"
   - Next to "Electronic" is "Songwriter"
   - And the last one is labeled "Hip-Hop"

8. At the bottom of the main area, there's a descriptive text that reads "A diverse collection of keyboards and synthesizers."

9. In the lower-right corner, there is a button labeled "Choose" which likely confirms the selection of a project template.

These elements combined suggest the user is at the starting point for creating a new musical project, with various templates to choose from.
