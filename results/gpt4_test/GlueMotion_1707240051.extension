The UI interface of the app shown in the image contains various elements:

1. Top navigation bar:
   - A "< Go Back" link on the left side.
   - Title tabs: "Frames," "Transforms," "Adjustments," "Blending," "Speed," "Export."
   - On the far right side of this bar, there are three icons: a shopping cart, a magnifying glass for search, and a profile or account symbol.

2. Main content area:
   - This area displays the image or video being edited, with a two-pane layout. The left pane shows the visual content; the right pane has adjustment controls.
   - In the right pane, a titled section "Adjust Colors" with a subheading "Adjust colors using keyframes".
   - Below the titles, there are several collapsible menus with sliders and circular buttons next to them for further settings: "White Balance," "Motion," "Noise Reduction," "Color Controls," "Light Correction," "Exposure Correction," "Gamma Correction," "Hue Correction," and "Sepia Tone."

3. Bottom navigation:
   - Four video playback control icons (presumably "Previous frame," "Play/Pause," "Stop," "Next frame").
   - A ratio indicator "1/2" probably indicating that the user is viewing the first of two items.
   - A horizontal slider that is likely meant to seek through the video or select a specific frame.
   - A drop-down labeled "More" with a downward arrow indicating more options or settings.
   - A "Continue" button with an arrow, likely to proceed with the next step in the editing process or to save the changes.

The interface seems to be designed for editing visual content, with a focus on video or photo color adjustment and enhancement.
