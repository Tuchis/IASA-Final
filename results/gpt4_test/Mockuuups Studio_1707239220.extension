This is a screenshot of a user interface for a mockup creation app, titled "Mockuuups Studio." The interface is divided into several sections, with a variety of buttons and options available:

1. Top-left corner: There is a 'back' arrow button, indicating the user can return to the previous screen or menu.

2. Top-center: Three tabs labeled 'Device', 'Color', and 'Shadow'. 'Color' is currently selected, suggesting these tabs switch between different customization options for the mockup.

3. Top-right corner: A button labeled 'Done', which presumably finalizes the changes or exits the current editing mode.

4. Center-left: A representation of a smartphone is displayed against a checkered background which typically signifies transparency.

5. Center-right: The 'Edit Color' panel with several customization options:
   - A section labeled 'PHOTOREALISTIC' with eight color swatches to choose from.
   - A 'CLAY' section with nine color swatches.
   - A 'Custom Color' button beneath 'CLAY', suggesting the user can select a custom color not shown in the swatches.
   - A section labeled 'SHAPE' with six color swatches and another 'Custom Color' button underneath.

6. Top bar: At the top of the 'Edit Color' panel, aside from the tabs, there are additional buttons:
   - 'Hand' – likely adds a hand holding the device to the mockup.
   - 'Background' – probably allows changing the background of the mockup.
   - 'Overlay' – possibly provides options to overlay graphics or effects on the mockup.
   - A star icon labeled 'Inspire Me' – possibly a feature that provides inspiration or randomization of mockup elements for the user.

These elements together comprise the editing interface that allows the user to customize the appearance of the device mockup within the app.
