The photo shows the user interface of the OpenIn Settings application. Here's a detailed description of the UI elements as seen in the image:

At the very top left corner, there are three window control buttons typically used for closing, minimizing, and maximizing the window.

At the top center, there is the application logo followed by the text "OpenIn Settings."

Below the application name, a horizontal menu is present with the following items:
- General (currently selected as indicated by the highlighting underneath the text)
- Browsers
- Mail apps
- Call apps
- Files
- Backups
- About

On the right side of the horizontal menu, there are three additional buttons:
- A button with a symbol suggestive of toggling or settings
- A button with a schematic representation of a window with formatting lines
- An information ("i") button

In the main content area below the horizontal menu, there are several sections with headers and corresponding settings:

1. Under the "Build" header:
   - A text description that probably contains version information for the app, which reads "4.1.5 (221064) Setapp build"

2. In the "Configuration" section, there are two toggle switches:
   - "Start at login"
   - "Show menu bar icon"
   A question mark button is placed at the rightmost part of this section.

3. The "Notifications" section contains one toggle switch:
   - "Check that OpenIn is a default app in background"

4. Under the "History" header:
   - A toggle switch labeled "Store history of opened links and files"
   - A dropdown menu identified by "Month" with a downward-pointing arrow, suggesting that you can select how long the history should be stored.

5. The "App selection window" section has a couple of settings:
   - A toggle switch labeled "Always show the Window (even with one app)"
   - Under the "Icon Size" label, three radio button options labeled "Small," "Medium," and "Large," with "Small" currently selected.

At the very bottom, there's a header "Developer Mode" which doesn't have any visible UI elements associated with it in this image.

The background of the application is gray, and the selected or active toggle switches and radio buttons are shown with a filled circular indicator. Additionally, there is some text and a scrollbar on the right side, but no specific content can be seen as it's either cut off or not in focus.
