The image shows a user interface for an application called "OpenIn Settings." The UI elements include:

1. Window control buttons at the top left corner, typically to minimize, maximize, and close the window.
2. A top navigation bar with several tabs: "General," "Browsers," "Mail apps," "Call apps," "Files," "Backups," and "About" which is the currently selected tab.
3. A section header titled "About" indicating that the content below belongs to the "About" category of settings.
4. A greeting message beginning with a waving hand emoji followed by text that introduces Denis Gladkikh as the author of OpenIn.
5. Several paragraphs providing context about the app, its development, and the developer's commitment to the users.
6. A hyperlink text directing to the FAQ section of the OpenIn website.
7. Instructions for how users can start a discussion or send an email if they have questions, with a subreddit link and an email address provided respectively.
8. An invitation to subscribe to a newsletter, with a hyperlink text "Subscribe to newsletter."
9. A button at the bottom labeled "Export logs..." which appears to be an actionable item for the user to perform some kind of export function.

Please note that descriptions of color, style, and any graphical icons used to represent the tabs aside from the titles have been omitted as per the instructions.
