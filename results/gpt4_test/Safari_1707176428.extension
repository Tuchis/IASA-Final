The image appears to be a screenshot of a web browser displaying a Google search page. On this page, a cookie consent pop-up is visible, interrupting the search experience. Here are the elements described from top to bottom:

- A search bar at the top with some browser tabs visible.
- Browser navigation buttons including the back, forward, and refresh buttons.
- A Google search bar partially visible with the search query "iasa champ" visible.
- Browser extension icons and the profile icon can be seen on the top right corner.
- A language selection button labeled "EN".
- A "Sign in" button.
- The main content being obscured by the cookie consent pop-up titled "Before you continue to Google".
- Within the cookie popup:
  - A message that starts with "We use cookies and data to".
  - A list of purposes for using cookies such as delivering and maintaining services, tracking outages, measuring engagement, and several others.
  - An option to accept these explanations with a button labeled "Accept all".
  - An option to reject with a button labeled "Reject all".
  - A highlighted slider button as part of the "Accept all" option.
  - A link labeled "More options" for additional settings.
- Below the popup, there are hyperlinks that are partially visible, which appear to be Google search results.
- At the very bottom, there are three additional buttons labeled "Reject all," "Accept all," and "More options," which correspond to user consent interaction choices. These appear to be a duplicate set of options to the ones inside the cookie popup message.
- In the lower left corner of the page, links to "Privacy" and "Terms" are visible.

Because the cookie consent pop-up is prominent, certain elements of the underlying Google search page are not fully visible in the screenshot.
