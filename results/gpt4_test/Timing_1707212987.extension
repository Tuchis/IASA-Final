The image displays a user interface for an application that appears to be related to time management and offers an email course. The UI elements include:

1. A top-right corner button labeled "Skip."
2. A large, bold header text stating, "Track your time like a pro."
3. A smaller subtext that continues below the header, indicating that users should look out for a free email course and explains they will learn to save even more time.
4. An icon resembling an envelope is centered on the screen, representing email or messaging.
5. Below the envelope icon is an email text field that already contains an email address.
6. A small text below this field mentioning that when a user signs up, their email address will need to be stored but reassures that they will never spam. It includes a "Learn More" link.
7. At the bottom left, there is a "Back" button.
8. In the bottom center, there is a slider with dots indicating multiple steps or pages within the UI, where one dot appears to be highlighted, likely indicating the current step.
9. At the bottom right, there is a button labeled "Send Me the Course" which seems to be the primary call to action.
