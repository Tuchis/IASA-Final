The image shows a pop-up window titled "AI Characters" with a description that states "AI characters are pre-built bots that you can chat with. All characters are customized with specific context, training data, and model settings. Click "Create Character" to explore more options."

At the top of the pop-up, there are four tabs:

1. "Your Characters (0)" - This indicates there are currently no characters in this tab.
2. "Personal Coaches (22)" - This tab likely contains 22 characters that are personal coaches.
3. "Specialized Assistants (4)" - This tab likely contains 4 specialized assistant characters.
4. "Language Tutors" - The tab does not indicate how many language tutor characters are available.

Below the tabs, there is a search bar labeled "Search characters."

Below the search bar, there are sorting options with a dropdown menu that currently displays "Title". To the right of this dropdown, there is a button labeled "+ Create Character."

Underneath these features are four listed AI characters, each accompanied by an icon, a title, a description, and an "+ Add" button:

1. "Pro Coder" - The description suggests this bot can help write code.
2. "Equation Master" - This character can discuss math and render math expressions or formulas.
3. "Technician Troubleshooter" - A bot designed to assist in diagnosing and fixing technical issues with devices.
4. "Language Tutor" - Described as a tutor that can help with language learning goals.

At the bottom of the pop-up, there is a "Close" button that likely closes the window.

Outside of the pop-up, there are partly visible components of the main application screen, including a search field in the top left corner, some navigation or status icons at the top, and a portion of a vertical list that appears to contain chat or conversation threads, identifiable by profile pictures and preview texts.

Below the main application area, on the left side, there is a tab labeled "API Keys," among other obscured tabs, and at the bottom right, there is a chat window icon and possibly other interaction features. There are several other icons and texts that are partially visible, indicating additional functionality or settings within the app.
