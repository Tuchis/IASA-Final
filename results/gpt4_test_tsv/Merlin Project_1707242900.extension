In the UI interface, there are several elements as described below:

1. At the top of the window, there is a title which reads "Merlin Project Express".

2. Just below the window control buttons (three dots), there's a side panel on the left with four items:
   - A symbol that looks like a piece of paper with a corner folded, labeled "New Document"
   - A clock-like symbol indicating "Recent Documents"
   - A question mark inside a circle indicating "Help & Instructions"
   - A symbol that appears to represent a folder or file system, labeled "Own Templates"

3. In the main panel, there are two sections:
   - The first section at the top has two options:
     - A square named "Empty Document" with a document icon.
     - Another square named "Demo Document" with a presentation or projection screen icon.
   - The second section is labeled "Templates", containing six options, each with an icon and text:
     - "Big birthday"
     - "Online advertising campaign"
     - "Road trip"
     - "Simple activity plan"
     - "Start of self employment"
     - "Wedding"

4. Below the template section, there's a button labeled "Open existing document…".

5. At the bottom, there are two buttons aligned to the right:
   - A button labeled "Cancel"
   - Another button labeled "Create"
