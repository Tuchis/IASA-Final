In the provided image, you are looking at a user interface of an application designed for creating mockups, specifically "Mockuuups Studio". Below are the UI elements presented:

1. Top Menu Bar:
   - "M" logo on the far left 
   - Navigation tabs which include, from left to right: rounded rectangles with icons depicting: a desktop computer, hands, a square (possibly indicating orientation), and a checkered box (indicating transparency)
   - A magnifying glass icon indicating a search function, accompanied by a search input field that reads "Search 4032 mockups"
   - "Sign In" button on the far right

2. A set of filter tabs below the top menu bar:
   - Four rectangular tabs labeled "All," "Customizable," "Favorites," and "Personal"

3. Main Content Area:
   - A large area displaying various previews of mockup images, each with a placeholder representing a phone screen. Three of these images are partially visible in the current view.
   - A highlighted rectangular area on the left side with a "+" icon and text "Open Editor" and "Create new mockup" beneath the icon.

4. The right side of the main content area has a section labeled "Drag & Drop or select an option below" with supplementary text "We support PNG or JPEG files." Below this are three icons indicating different ways to import images:
   - An icon representing file import ("From this device")
   - An icon representing screenshot import ("Screenshot")
   - An icon representing import from a mobile device ("From mobile")

5. Below the import options, there are logos for what looks like file format options or software compatibilities, including Adobe Photoshop (Ps) and Sketch.

6. Bottom-right corner:
   - A large blue forward arrow in a circle, which possibly indicates a way to proceed to the next step in the app's workflow.

7. Bottom-left corner:
   - Partially visible icons that seem to represent more navigation or functionality, but their specific purposes are not evident from the cropped view.

The UI is structured in a way that guides the user from mockup selection or creation on the left towards the import options on the right, finishing with the advancement option in the bottom-right corner.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements.
