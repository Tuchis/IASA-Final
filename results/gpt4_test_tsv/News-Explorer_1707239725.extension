This appears to be a screenshot of a desktop user interface, possibly from an RSS feed reader or a similar content aggregation application with a split-screen layout, having two main panels.

On the left side, we see the navigation menu and content organization elements:

1. At the top, there are three circular icons, likely for window management actions such as closing, minimizing, and maximizing the window.
2. Below that, there is a section labeled "Smart Filters" with options:
   - Latest News (with a number count next to it)
   - Unread Items (with a number count next to it)
   - Favorites (star icon with no count)
3. There's a section named "Subscriptions" with various sources listed underneath, each with a distinctive icon and a number count next to it, representing unread articles or posts.
4. At the very bottom, there are three icons that are common in user interfaces for additional actions or settings:
   - A plus sign (+), presumably to add new items or manage subscriptions.
   - Two horizontal lines with dots, which might indicate a way to access settings or more options.
   - A star icon, possibly for marking items as favorites or accessing favorite items.

On the right side, the content viewing portion of the UI:

1. At the very top, there are icons including a back arrow, a circle with a dot in the center, a square outline (which could be for expanding the content panel or engaging fullscreen mode), and a star (potentially for favoriting the current article).
2. Next to these icons is a search box with a magnifying glass icon, indicating functionality to search content.
3. Below that, there's the header of an article with the title "Machine Learning Blog | ML@..." truncated, followed by date information that reads "1 month ago".
4. The main content area shows the headline of an article titled “On Noisy Evaluation in Federated Hyperparameter Tuning” and includes the publishing details such as "Friday, 29 December 2023, 18:04". It appears to be authored by someone from Carnegie Mellon University named Kevin Kuo.
5. An abstract or brief description of the article is visible, talking about federated networks and the challenges of evaluating models due to various factors including privacy and data heterogeneity.
6. Accompanying the article is a diagram or figure with various elements representing an evaluation process or concept in machine learning, specifically related to federated networks and hyperparameter tuning.

**Note:** The specific functionality of some icons might differ depending on the actual application and context.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements.

41	38	StaticText	[662, 286, 384, 90]	[854.0, 331.0]	Evaluating models in federated networks is challenging due to factors such as client subsampling, data heterogeneity, and privacy. These factors introduce noise that can affect hyperparameter tuning algorithms and lead to suboptimal model selection. Hyperparameter tuning is critical to the success of cross-device federated learning applications. Unfortunately, federated networks face issues of scale, heterogeneity, and privacy, which introduce noise in the tuning process and make it difficult to faithfully evaluate the performance of various hyperparameters. Our work (MLSys’23) explores key sources of noise and surprisingly shows that even small amounts of noise can have a significant impact on tuning methods—reducing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches to that of naive baselines. To address noisy evaluation in such scenarios, we propose a simple and effective approach that leverages public proxy data to boost the evaluation signal. Our work establishes general challenges, baselines, and best practices for future work in federated hyperparameter tuning. Federated Learning: An Overview Cross-device federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting that considers training a model over a large heterogeneous network of devices such as mobile phones or wearables. Three key factors differentiate FL from traditional centralized learning and distributed learning: Scale. Cross-device refers to FL settings with […]
