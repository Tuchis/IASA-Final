In the UI interface of the app displayed in the photo, you can see several distinct areas and elements listed as follows:

1. Top-left corner: Three horizontally-aligned dots - typical representation of a window control panel for minimizing, maximizing and closing the window.

2. Left sidebar:
   - An icon resembling a play button labeled "Tracking"
   - An icon that looks like a clock face or a timeline labeled "Timeline"
   - An icon with two stacked horizontal bars that could represent reports, labeled "Reports"

3. Center-Left section:
   - Three tabs named "All Tasks", "Recent", and "Archive" with a "+" button next to them and a downward-pointing arrow indicating a dropdown menu or additional options.
   - A large button with the text "Start timer".
   - A description text underneath that says "to create the first task or import your existing data".
   - A hyperlink or button labeled "Import data as CSV..."

4. Bottom-left corner:
   - A digital clock display reading "00:00:00".
   - Text below the timer that reads "No Task" with a play button icon next to it, signaling that it could be a button to start timing a task.

5. Center-Right section:
   - A header with the text "Time Entries" and a subheader saying "last 30 days".
   - A "+" button and a button that appears to be a trash can icon, which typically suggests a delete function.

6. Main Panel:
   - A message in bold that reads "No time entries found".
   - A smaller message underneath that recommends to "Add a time entry or start the timer" along with a "+" button, probably for adding new time entries.

These elements together suggest that the app is designed for tracking time, managing tasks, and possibly generating reports based on time-tracked data.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements.
