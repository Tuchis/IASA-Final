This image shows a user interface with multiple panels and interactive elements. Starting from the left:

1. The leftmost sidebar contains two items: "All Apps" and "Finder," with corresponding icons. Below, there are buttons for adding (+) and a trash can icon indicating a delete function. At the bottom, there is a magnifying glass icon suggesting a search function and another addition (+) button.

2. The header section features backward and forward navigation arrows, icons representing a "save" action and "Touch Bar Settings," followed by two buttons that look like a slider control and a list or menu, respectively. Then, there's a dropdown menu labeled "Preset: Default" and a menu or options button (three dots).

3. The main central section is divided into two panels:
   - The left panel states "Please Select a Trigger" with a large plus (+) symbol.
   - The right panel states "Assign First Action to Selected Trigger" also with a large plus (+) symbol.

4. The rightmost panel is labeled "Touch Bar Trigger Configuration," and within that panel, there is a button with the text "Select Trigger" and a dropdown arrow indicating a selection list.
