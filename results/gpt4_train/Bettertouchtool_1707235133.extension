This image displays a user interface which appears to be for configuring mouse settings or shortcuts within an application. Starting from the top left, there's a navigation menu with an option labeled "All Apps" and another labeled "Finder." Next to this sidebar, there is a larger main panel divided into three sections:

The top section has a navigation arrow pointing leftward, a symbol of a mouse, a label "Normal Mouse," a button with a refresh icon, text "Normal Mouse Settings," a pause icon, three stacked lines possibly for additional options, a dropdown box labeled "Preset: Default," and a three-dot menu icon.

The middle section is a table or list area with headers "Config" and "Trigger Name." Inside it, there's a placeholder text that says "Please click below to select button" and another box with text "Click here & select."

The bottom section has a smaller plus icon, a minus icon, a symbol with vertical lines arranged in ascending order with a plus symbol at the bottom, and text "Attach additional action."

On the right side of the image, there is a separate panel labeled "Normal Mouse Configuration." This panel is subdivided into two tabs: "Basic Config" and "Advanced." Below these tabs:

- There's an area with a prompt "Click to record a mouse button:" followed by a placeholder button that says "Please Select a Trigger."
- Next is a selection labeled "Select Required Modifiers:" with boxes for "shift," "fn," "ctrl," "opt," and "cmd."
- Below that, there's a field labeled "Notes:" with an emoticon, and a box to be ticked with text "Show notes instead of description."
- Finally, there's a clickable link or button that says "Problems with click recognition?"
