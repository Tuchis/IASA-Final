Sure, this is a screenshot of a user interface from a VPN application showing a list of keyboard shortcuts designed to speed up user actions within the app. Here are the UI elements as described:

On the left side, there's a vertical menu with the following items:
- Account
- Your devices
- System settings
- Shortcuts (highlighted, indicating the current selection)
- Stand with Ukraine, which includes an emoji of the Ukrainian flag
- Need help?
Below the menu, there's a highlighted message box with text that reads "Are you sure all your devices are protected?" and a status note saying "7 of 8 slots remaining."

On the top right of the screen, there's a header titled "Shortcuts" with an "X" button to presumably close the window.

Below the header, there are three shortcut categories, each with their respective functions:

1. VPN activation:
   - "Activate VPN mode" with a keyboard icon and a "return" button.
   - "Details screen" with a keyboard icon and a downward-pointing chevron button.
   - "Switch between smart presets" with left and right arrow buttons.
   - "Switch between VPN modes" with up and down chevron buttons.

2. Navigation:
   - "Open settings" with a keyboard icon showing the command symbol and the "&" symbol followed by a ",".
   - "Back to the main screen" with an "esc" button.
   - "Search for countries in Location changer" with a keyboard icon showing the command symbol and the letter "F".
 
3. Close the app:
   - "Quit the app" with a keyboard icon showing the command symbol and the letter "Q".
   - "Hide the app" with a keyboard icon showing the command symbol and the letter "W".

The layout provides clear sections for different types of actions that users can take using keyboard shortcuts, with buttons that illustrate what keys to press for each action.
