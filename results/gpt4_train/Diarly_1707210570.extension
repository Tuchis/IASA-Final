The image displays a user interface of a journaling app, with several distinct elements:

On the left-hand side of the screen, we have a sidebar:

1. At the top of the sidebar, there's a magnifying glass icon indicating a search functionality followed by a search text field where users can input text to search within the app.
2. Below the search bar, there are two tabs. The first one shows an emoji followed by "My Journal", which suggests that this is a personalized journal section. The second tab is titled "All Notes", suggesting it displays all the entries or notes.
3. In the sidebar, there is a "View" section with five different icons:
   - A "List" icon indicating a list view.
   - A "Calendar" icon suggesting a calendar view.
   - A "Map" icon indicating a geolocation or map view.
   - A "Gallery" icon suggesting a media or photo view.
   - A "Stats" icon likely indicating a statistics or analytics view of the user's journal entries.
4. After these view options, there's a "Settings" icon, presumably to adjust the app's settings.

In the main content area on the right-hand side of the screen, there are two visible panels:

1. The first panel on the right, the top bar includes:
   - A grid icon which might open additional options or modules.
   - A bell icon which typically represents notifications or reminders.
   - A circular icon that likely takes the user to the current day's entry or view.
   - A three-dots vertical icon suggesting more options or settings.

2. The main content of this panel displays text, comprising:
   - A welcome message titled "Welcome to Diarly" followed by a short introduction paragraph.
   - A timestamp indicating "2m" which likely means the welcome note was created 2 minutes ago.
   - Two icons at the bottom, one resembling sharing/exporting functionality and the other resembling more options (ellipsis icon).

3. The second panel on the right features:
   - An arrow icon pointing left, a calendar icon with "Tue, 6 February" showing the date, and an arrow icon pointing right at the top bar, suggesting navigation between dates.
   - Text prompts for journaling such as "Three small things I'm grateful for:", "What is my positive intention for the day?", and "How did I feel today and what patterns or triggers did I notice?"
   - Below the text prompts, there is a location tagged as "Kyiv, Antonovycha Street" along with weather-related icons and text indicating "2Â°C" and a wind power indicator.
   - At the bottom of this entry, there are tags or categories shown as "#StartingOut" and "Welcome to Diarly" with an associated icon.

4. A note editing tool panel is partially visible with options such as "Heading 1," "Checklist," "Quote," "List," "Ordered List," "Insert current time," "Insert current date," "Insert time-separator," "Insert weather," and "Insert current location."

The UI seems to be designed for ease of use, with clear labeling and categorization of features for an appealing user experience in creating and navigating journal entries.
