In this UI interface of an app, from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, we have the following elements:

1. At the top-left corner of the screen, there is a "Cancel" button.
2. Just beside the "Cancel" button, moving to the right, there are three tabs labeled "Expense", "Income", and "Transfer". The "Expense" tab appears to be the active selection.
3. To the far right, at the top of the screen, there is a "Done" button.
4. Below the tabs, there is a text field with a placeholder text that reads "How much?".
5. Right below this field, there is a currency selection button labeled "USD", beside which is a larger text field displaying the currency amount "-0,00 US$".
6. Below the currency amount field, there is another text field with placeholder text "Notes" intended for entering additional details.
7. Following that, there is a category selection with an icon representing categories and a text area next to it reading "No Category" with a navigation arrow pointing to the right, suggesting that it opens a further selection menu.
8. Underneath the category section, there is a label "Sheet:" followed by a button labeled "Planner" with a navigation arrow pointing to the right.
9. Next, there are two fields labeled "Date" and "Time," respectively, with the date set to "05.02.2024" and the time to "23:34."
10. Below the date and time fields, there is a checkbox next to the word "Pending," which is currently unchecked.
11. Following the pending checkbox, there is a repeat section with an icon to its left and a button to the right labeled "Never" with a navigation arrow, indicating an additional menu for setting repeat options.
12. At the very bottom left corner of the screen, there is a button with a "+" symbol and the text "New Sheet".
13. Adjacent to the "New Sheet" button, there is a settings icon, which likely provides access to more options or settings for the app.

On the left-hand sidebar, separate from the main dialog:

1. Under the title "Sheets," there is a selection labeled "Planner" with a monetary value and a timestamp next to it.

At the top of the screen, separate from the main dialog:

1. There is a "+" sign for possibly adding a new element or feature.
2. There are icons which seem to represent connectivity or syncing status, and a magnifying glass icon probably for search functionality.

Keep in mind that without color or interactive context, some assumptions are being made about the functionality of these buttons and text fields based on standard UI design conventions.
