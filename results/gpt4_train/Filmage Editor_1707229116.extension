The image depicts a UI interface of a video editing software application. Here are the elements within the interface starting from the top left and moving to the right and then downwards:

1. The top left section has tabbed buttons that read as follows: "Media," "Resources," and "Effects."
2. Below the tabs, there is a sidebar with the following items listed vertically: "Transitions" (highlighted), "Animation," "Filter," "Special Effects," and "Mask."
3. Above the sidebar, there are two toggle buttons labeled "All" and "Favorite."
4. To the right of the sidebar is an area with preview thumbnails representing various video effects, such as "Fade to White," "Fade to Black," "Blend," "Spin," etc. There are two rows with four thumbnails in each row.
5. Near the top of the screen, centered is the title of the project which reads "Untitled 1.fmlg."
6. To the top right, there is a window labeled "Viewer" with a dropdown menu currently set to "16:9," and there is an "Export" button adjacent to it.
7. Below this area, there is a search field with a magnifying glass icon.
8. In the bottom section of the UI, there's a timeline with marked time intervals. Over the timeline, there are zoom controls, undetermined toggle or tool buttons, and vertical lines with handles, likely representing the playhead and markers.
9. In the bottom left corner is a toolbar with six icons, which appear to be commonly used tools in video editing software, such as selection, cut, or similar functionality, though their specific purposes are not labeled.
10. Along the very bottom, there is a horizontal slider with a handle, which could be for zooming in and out of the timeline.

Lastly, there's a message at the bottom of the timeline area that reads "Drag media and effects here to create your video."
