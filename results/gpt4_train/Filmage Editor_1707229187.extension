The UI interface in the image appears to be of a video editing application. Here are the elements present in the UI:

Top left corner:
- Three horizontal bars indicate a menu or panel.
- Text labels: "Media", "Resources", and "Effects", suggesting these are different tabs or sections within the menu.

Top middle area:
- A preview monitor that is currently displaying the default logo of the "Filmage Editor." This is likely the area where edited videos or media clips can be previewed.

Top right corner:
- Text indicating the project is "Untitled 1.flmg."
- A "Viewer" label followed by a dropdown menu that likely allows selection of the preview monitor's aspect ratio. It currently indicates "16:9."
- An "Export" button, presumably to render and export the video project.

Right sidebar:
- An information panel with the following attributes:
  - “Project Duration”
  - “Resolution”
  - “FPS”
  - “Video Encoder”
  - “Audio Encoder”
  - “Sample Rate”
  - “Sound Channel”
  - “Date Created”
  - “Date Modified”
  - “Size”
Each attribute has accompanying values (except "Size"), providing details about the current video editing project.

Bottom left corner:
- Tool icons that could represent functionalities such as import, cut, split, delete, media library, project settings, or similar editing tools.

Timeline:
- A horizontal timeline marked with time codes from "00:00:00:00" to "00:05:00:00". It contains tracks below the timecodes, and these tracks have icons that may permit adding various types of media (video, audio, text, effects).
- A vertical red marker which represents the current position or "playhead" on the timeline.
- A message stating "Drag media and effects here to create your video." This provides instruction for users on how to use the timeline area.

Bottom center:
- Playback controls that include typical buttons like play, stop, go to beginning, go to end, and possibly step-one-frame-forward/backward functions.

Bottom right corner:
- A set of elements that appear to be zoom controls for the timeline view.
- Three vertical dots indicating some additional menu or options.

Bottom bar:
- A horizontal slider that might be used for adjusting the preview volume or some other variable parameter in real-time.

The elements described focus on the functionality that each part of the UI likely serves within the video editing process.
