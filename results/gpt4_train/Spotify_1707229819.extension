The UI interface shown in the image appears to be from a music streaming application. Here are the elements present in the user interface:

1. Top-left corner: A series of three vertically stacked line icons, possibly a menu or navigation icon.
2. Top-right corner: Icons resembling a bell for notifications, and a silhouette of a person, potentially for user profile or account settings, with a letter 'M' next to it.

Between these two corners, there is a back arrow on the left, and three tabs indicating sequential sections of the application. The active section is titled "Ogre Vibes > Bad Vibes."

3. Below the section title is a description text, mentioning "Shrek songs to cure your depression," followed by the username 'Marichka' and a playlist summary with "10 songs, 32 min 20 sec."

4. Below the description text, there's a collection of icons: A play button, shuffle toggle, loop toggle, download icon, and a 'more' icon represented by three dots.

5. Adjacent to the 'more' icon on the right is a search field with a filter icon and text that says "Custom order."

6. Further down, there are column headers for a song list, which are '#', 'Title', 'Album', and an icon that presumably represents sorting or can be interacted with to change the play order.

7. Below the headers is the tracklist, displaying song numbers, artwork thumbnails, song titles, artists, album titles, and each song's duration. Songs listed are "All Star," "Funkytown," "I'm A Believer," "It Is You (I Have Loved)," "Bad Reputation," "My Beloved Monster."

8. At the very bottom of the image, there is a player control bar, which seems to contain from left to right: a Queue icon, a Devices icon, Previous Track, Play/Pause, Next Track buttons, a sound level bar, an icon likely for playlist or collection, another for broadcasting or devices connectivity, an icon for additional settings or options, and lastly, a speech bubble icon, presumably for social or sharing functions.

These elements collectively provide navigation, playback control, customization, and social features typically found in such applications.
