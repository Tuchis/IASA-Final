This image shows a UI interface for what appears to be an application settings window, possibly for a window management app named "Swish." Here are the elements present in the UI:

On the left-hand side, there is a vertical navigation pane with the following items, where one item is highlighted indicating the current selection:
- A cogwheel icon with the text "General" beside it.
- An icon resembling two overlapping windows with the text "Windows" beside it.
- A highlighted icon featuring a window with an arrow pointing inwards on each side, which reads "Snapping."
- An icon suggestive of application windows, with the label "Apps."
- An icon symbolizing a menu bar, with the text "Menubar."
- An icon of a cogwheel with connected dots, with the text "Advanced."
- An information icon with the text "About."

On the top right corner of the window, there is a "Quit" button.

In the main content area to the right, there are sections, titles, adjustable settings, toggle switches, and descriptive text with the following elements:

- The heading "Snapping" followed by a brief description about window snapping to different grid layouts.
- A "Grid Spacing" slider with a scale, a bubble indicating the current position, and a "Default" button beside it. There is a question mark icon indicating help or more information and accompanying text about the purpose of grid spacing.
- A section with toggle options and descriptions:
  - A checked checkbox labeled "Drag to Unsnap" with accompanying descriptive text.
  - An unchecked checkbox labeled "Activate Window" next to an unchecked checkbox labeled "Move Cursor" with no descriptive text shown.
  - A checked checkbox labeled "Resize Adjacent Windows" with descriptive text below it.

- A separator line, followed by a customizable key command section with checkboxes (none are checked in the image), swipe or tap command icons, and accompanying descriptive text for four functions:
  - "Center & Unsnap" with a double-tap hand gesture icon.
  - "Maximize" with an upward swipe gesture icon.
  - "Halves" with left and right swipe gesture icons.
  - "Vertical" with double upward and downward swipe gesture icons.

This interface allows users to customize how their windows behave through various gesture controls and spacing configurations.
