The UI interface in the image appears to be that of a wallpaper selection app or feature within a software program. The interface is divided into two main areas: the left side features a large preview of a currently selected wallpaper, while the right side provides options and smaller previews of other available wallpapers.

Here is the breakdown of the UI elements presented in the image:

1. **Top left corner**: There's a close button represented by an "X" that likely closes the current view or interface.

2. **Top center**: Text displaying the name of the wallpaper in view, "Onion Valley (High Sierras)" which is the subject of the large preview image. Next to it is a button with the text "FIXED VIEW," suggesting a feature that allows the user to fix the current view, likely preventing it from changing automatically.

3. **Top right corner**: There is a heart icon, typically representing a favorite or like feature, allowing users to mark wallpapers they like. Next to it is a download button represented by an arrow pointing down into a horizontal line, suggesting that users can download the currently selected wallpaper. There is also a time display "Previewing at 17:30," indicating the time when this wallpaper is set to be displayed if the application changes wallpapers automatically.

4. **Sidebar right area**: This section includes the title "Editors’ Choice" with a blue information icon, suggesting that the wallpapers here are specially curated or recommended selections. Beneath is text indicating the user is "Browsing 36 of 105 wallpapers," showing the current position in the wallpaper library.

5. **Wallpaper Thumbnails**: Below the "Editors' Choice" section, there are three smaller thumbnails of other wallpapers available for selection — "White Sands #2," "Yosemite (Lukens Lake)," and "Yosemite (Tioga Road)" with their respective titles below each image.

6. **Bottom of sidebar**: There's a button labeled "Show All Wallpapers," which likely takes the user to a view where they can browse the full collection of available wallpapers.

Overall, the UI design suggests a user-friendly experience to select, preview, and download wallpapers, with additional tools for favoriting and obtaining information about the images. It also seems to feature an automated wallpaper changing option with schedules for different wallpapers, as indicated by the preview time.
