The image depicts a UI interface of an application named "Almighty." The interface is designed in a clean and minimalist style, typical for modern software, especially on macOS. Here's a description of the visible elements in the UI:

1. **Top-left corner:** There are three colored circles, which indicate the window control buttons for close (red), minimize (yellow) and maximize/restore (green).

2. **Left Sidebar:**
    - **Section Headers:**
        - "All" - Icon of four squares represents the view that shows all available settings.
        - "New" - Icon of a star likely indicates a view with newly added features or settings.
        - "Popular" - Icon of a thumbs up, possibly showing the most liked or frequently used settings.
        - "Random" - Icon of four squares arranged haphazardly, could offer a random selection of settings.
    - **Apps Section Header**
   
    Under the Apps section, there are categories named after system features or specific applications, each with an associated icon, including:
    
        - "Desktop" - Desktop personalization settings.
        - "Display" - Monitor/display settings.
        - "Dock" - macOS Dock configuration.
        - "Effect" - Visual or audio effects settings.
        - "Finder" - Currently selected, indicating settings associated with the macOS Finder application. The selection is highlighted in blue.
        - "Keyboard" - Keyboard settings.
        - "Mouse" - Mouse or touchpad settings.
        - "Photos" - Settings regarding image management or the Photos app.
        - "Screenshot" - Configuration options for taking screenshots.

3. **Top Center:** The main toolbar features a hamburger menu icon on the left, followed by the application's name "Almighty." There is a search field to its right, with a magnifying glass icon indicating its purpose and placeholder text "Search."

4. **Main Content Area:** This part displays toggles for specific Finder settings (since Finder is selected in the sidebar) with a brief description of each and their respective icons:
    - **Add Quit Option:** A toggle switch (currently set to OFF) with a leaf icon for adding a "Quit" option to the Finder menu.
    - **Show File Extension:** This toggle (also in the OFF position) with a sunglasses icon enables displaying all file extensions in the Finder.
    - **Show File Full Path:** Another toggle switch (OFF position) with a detective-like icon that, when activated, would display the full file path in the Finder title bar.

Each of the three toggle options in the main content area includes the name of the feature, a brief description of what the toggle does, and an icon representing the Finder.

The interface elements have a consistent design language, conveying a clear and organized method for users to customize their experience with the application, specifically targeting enhancements and modifications to the macOS Finder.
