The UI interface appears to be from an application store designed for a desktop operating system. The overall layout is divided into two main panels: a navigation sidebar on the left and a content area on the right.

**Left Sidebar:**
- At the top, there are three colored dots suggesting the window controls for close, minimize, and maximize.
- Below that is a search bar with a magnifying glass icon and the placeholder text "Search."
- A menu list follows with several options each with an icon and text:
  - Discover
  - Arcade
  - Create (selected/hightlighted indicating current view)
  - Work
  - Play
  - Develop
  - Categories
  - Updates (has a badge with the number 5, indicating there are five updates available)

**Right Content Area:**
- The large header 'Create' signals the current section.
- Below the header are two content blocks each with a heading:

  1. "GET STARTED" block:
     - Subtitle: "Sketch on paper, polish on Mac"
     - Description: "Linearity Curve turns drawings into vectors."
     - This block has an elaborate illustration depicting three characters being creative with paper and digital devices. 

  2. "APPS WE LOVE" block:
     - Subtitle: "Find your groove"
     - Description: "Mixing app Djay will rock your next party."
     - There is a graphical representation of a turntable or music mixing interface.

- Additionally, below both these blocks is a section titled “Great New Creative Apps and Updates” featuring a horizontal list of apps:
  - Each app representation in the list includes:
    - An app icon.
    - The app name and a brief description.
    - A button that either says "Get" indicating the app can be downloaded for free or displays the price (for example "£14.99" or "£199.99") indicating that the app must be purchased. Some buttons indicate "In-App Purchases" suggesting additional content or services available within the app for extra cost.
  - To the right of this section is a "See All" link, presumably to browse more apps in this category.

**Bottom Left Corner:**
- An element, likely the profile or account section, with a horizontal bar pattern and the name "Mariya Hirna."

**Overall Context:**
- The interface is likely for a curated section of the application store, focused on creative tools and resources, according to the highlighted "Create" section and the nature of the listed apps.
- The UI suggests a user-friendly approach with easily recognizable icons and a clean layout for exploring and downloading apps.

Please note that due to the constraints, I have not identified any potentially recognisable trademarks or logos.
