This appears to be a screenshot of a documentation viewer or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) displaying documentation for functions related to CUDA-enabled image processing within the OpenCV library. Let's go through each of the elements:

On the top-left corner, there's a navigation sidebar with the header "Functions", which seemingly allows you to browse through different functions. The sidebar contains a list of function names, with the current selection highlighted on `cv::cuda::buildWarpAffineMaps`. The navigation sidebar includes, from top to bottom, the following items:

- `cv::cuda::buildWarpAffineMaps`
- `cv::cuda::buildWarpPerspectiveMaps`
- `cv::cuda::pyrDown`
- `cv::cuda::pyrUp`
- `cv::cuda::remap`
- `cv::cuda::resize`
- `cv::cuda::rotate`
- `cv::cuda::warpAffine`
- `cv::cuda::warpPerspective`

Below the navigation sidebar, there's additional blank space which might allow for scrolling if there are more items in the list.

At the top of the window, there is a standard window control with three buttons on the left for close, minimize, and maximize/zoom of the window.

In the top-right corner, there's a search bar with a magnifying glass icon on the left and an 'x' on the right, indicating the ability to clear the search. The search bar has placeholder text "Search," suggesting you can type in it to find other functions or content within the documentation.

Below the search bar, there's a breadcrumb navigation path that starts with an icon that possibly represents a home or root directory, followed by `:: Functions`. This likely shows the current location in the documentation hierarchy and indicates that the user is viewing functions within a certain context or module.

In the main content area, there are three separate code documentation blocks for the `buildWarpAffineMaps` function. This function is overloaded, as indicated by the "(2/3)" and "(3/3)" tabs near the top of the first two blocks, which suggests that there are three variations of this function and the screenshot shows the second and third variations.

Each block contains the function signature, which includes the function name, return type (`void`), namespace (`cv::cuda::`), and parameters. Parameters include `Mat` or `UMat` objects, a `bool` for `inverse`, a `Size` object for `dsize`, `GpuMat` references for `xmap` and `ymap`, and a reference to a `Stream`. The default argument for the `Stream` parameter is `Stream::Null()`.

Above the function signature in the first detailed block, there's a line that includes `#include <cudawarping.hpp>` suggesting the user needs to include this header file to use the function.

Each documentation block has an "inline" button at the bottom-right corner, which could likely be used to toggle the view of inline documentation or code examples if available.

This user interface is typically used by software developers to understand how to use different functions provided by a library, in this case, the CUDA-accelerated computer vision functions provided by OpenCV.
