This image shows a screenshot of an app interface titled "Customize your daily prompt." It appears to be a setup or preferences screen for a diary or journaling application where users can personalize the automatic data collection for their daily entries.

At the top, there is a header with a larger, bolded text that reads: 

"Customize your daily prompt"

Below the header is a paragraph of explanatory text:

"Every day when you open Diarly, a new entry will be automatically created for you. We recommend allowing the following information to be imported:"

Following this explanatory text, there is a list of data types that can be imported automatically into each entry:

1. A checkbox with a checkmark indicating an active selection, accompanied by a location icon (red map pin) and the text "Location"

2. A checkbox with a checkmark indicating an active selection, accompanied by a heart icon which is a representation for "Health" (often associated with health data or fitness apps), and the text "Health" with an information symbol (circle with an i in the center). To the right of this is additional text specifying what health data is included â€” "Workouts - total duration." There's a drop-down arrow suggesting that a user might be able to choose different data points related to health.

3. A checkbox with a checkmark indicating an active selection, accompanied by a half moon icon (suggesting sleep data) and the text "Last night's sleep duration" with an information symbol (circle with an i in the center).

Below the list of recommended data, there's a subtitle for additional options:

"Additionally, you can choose to import:"

Below this subtitle, there are more options:

1. A checkbox with a checkmark indicating an active selection, accompanied by a cloud and sun icon suggestive of weather, and the text "Weather"

2. A checkbox without a checkmark (indicating it is not selected by default), accompanied by a calendar icon (squares arranged in a grid) with the text "Events from Calendar"

3. A checkbox with a checkmark indicating an active selection, accompanied by an indentation, suggesting the checkbox has been interactively customized, and the text "Uncompleted Tasks from previous day."

At the bottom of the interface, there is reassurance text for the user:

"You can always modify or disable the daily prompt later as needed"

The bottommost part of the interface contains a prominent action button with the text "Continue" on a reddish background indicating it's probably the next step button after customizing the selections.

The overall context of this interface seems to aim at setting up a personalized daily prompt for a journaling app with the user's permission to import various elements of data to create an automated journal entry for each day.
