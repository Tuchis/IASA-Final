   - An indicator showing "Current streak: 1 day" and "Next level: 3 days" with a check mark next to it.

5. **Word Count Comparison Widget:**
   - A title "Your word count vs. famous books" and a bar comparing "Approaching: On the shortness of life by Seneca".

   - Below the title and to the left, a label "Words written" along with a line graph showing a spike at the end.

7. **Content Breakdown:**
   - Circular diagrams labeled "Content breakdown", showing percentage breakdowns for categories like "Journals", "Notes", "Attachments", each with 0% except for Journals which indicates 100%.

8. **Tasks Widget:**
