This image appears to display a mobile application's user interface that specializes in reminders and notifications. The UI contains various elements:

1. At the top left, there's a three-line hamburger menu icon, often used to indicate a menu or navigation drawer that can be pulled from the side.

2. Just to the right of the hamburger icon, there are status icons that typically appear on mobile devices, such as cellular signal strength, Wi-Fi connectivity, and battery status. However, due to the overlay, full details of these status icons cannot be discerned.

3. Below that, aligned to the left, there's a vertical navigation with three options:
   - The topmost icon looks like a checklist, followed by the word "Reminders". This is presumably the currently active section of the app.
   - The second icon features an hourglass, accompanied by the word "Timers".
   - The third icon shows a clipboard or log icon, next to the word "Logbook".

4. Below the vertical navigation, there's another icon which seems to signify some kind of issue or warning (exclamation mark within a triangle) which could be related to settings or alerts for the app.

5. At the bottom left, there's a plus (+) icon, which is commonly used to add a new item, such as a reminder or task, within an app.

6. At the top of the main app area (right-hand side), there is a search bar with a magnifying glass icon indicating the functionality to search, with the placeholder text "Search".

7. In the central part of the main app area, there's a large graphic that includes a notification bell with a speech bubble containing an exclamation mark, which typically indicates alerts or important notifications.

8. Below the graphic, the text reads "Permission to remind", which is a header or title indicating that the app is requesting permission to send reminders.

9. Below the title, there's additional explanatory text that states: "Please allow notifications so that Due can remind you." This indicates the app, named Due, is asking the user to enable push notifications for reminder functionality.

10. At the bottom, there's a purple button with the label "Allow Notifications", which when pressed, will likely prompt the user with the system permission dialog for allowing notifications from the app.
