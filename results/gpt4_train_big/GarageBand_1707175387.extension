This image shows the user interface of a music production application with various elements intended for recording and editing audio. In the center of the image, there is a pop-up window with the title "Choose a track type" that displays three options:

1. Software Instrument:
   - Icon: A keyboard with green highlights.
   - Description: "Plug in a USB MIDI keyboard to play and record using a wide variety of instruments like piano, organ and synths."
   
2. Audio:
   - Icon: A microphone.
   - Description: "Record using a microphone or line input â€“ or drag and drop audio files."

3. Drummer:
   - Icon: A drum kit.
   - Description: "Add a drummer that automatically plays along with your song."
    
Below these options is a "Details" section with selections specific to audio input:
   - "Input:" with an option for "Input 1" as a radio button.
   - A statement indicating "My instrument is connected with: MacBook Pro Microphone" with a checked checkbox.
   - Another statement saying, "I want to hear my instrument as I play and record" with a checked checkbox.
   - A third statement indicating "I heard sound from: MacBook Pro Speakers" with a checked checkbox.

At the bottom of the pop-up window, there is a gray "Cancel" button on the left and an active blue "Create" button on the right.

Below this pop-up window, we see a part of the main interface with some additional elements:

- A sidebar to the left with track information, showing "Movie" and "Audio 1", each with mute and solo buttons.
- Below the track headers, tabs labeled "Track", "Master", and "Compare" are visible.
- A section called "Recording Settings" with a "Record Level" slider and options for "Automatic Level Control", "Input" settings (selected as "No Input"), "Monitoring", and a "Noise Gate" feature.
- An equalizer section with sliders and knobs for adjusting levels, including "HIGH", "MID FREQ", "LOW CUT", and "REVERB".

The background elements show various other controls specific to the application, such as transport controls (play, pause, record, rewind, fast-forward), a timeline labeled with bars and beats, tempo, time signature, and a search field labeled "Search Loops" in the top right corner.

The entire interface suggests that the user is in the process of setting up a new track in a digital audio workstation (DAW) and has multiple options for input sources and manipulation of the sound.
