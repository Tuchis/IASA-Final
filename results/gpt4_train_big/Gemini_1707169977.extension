The image displays the user interface of an application during a "Scan in Progress". The design utilizes a dark theme with various shades of blue and gray. The UI elements are as follows:

1. Window Controls: In the top-left corner, there is the standard macOS window control buttons consisting of three dots in red, yellow, and green colors, which represent close, minimize, and maximize actions respectively.

2. Application Name: At the top center of the window, the word "Gemini" is displayed, likely indicating the name of the application.

3. Star or Favorite Button: In the top-right corner, there is a star icon, which might indicate a favorites or settings button.

4. Main Information Section: The center of the window has a large text that reads "Scan in Progress", indicating that the application is currently performing a scan.

5. Status Update Text: Below the "Scan in Progress" text, there is an updating message stating "Looking for duplicates...". This suggests that the application's purpose is to find duplicate files.

6. File Path: A file path is being displayed underneath the status update text, which is currently "...Projects/shukai/sh...627157919647.jpg". This suggests that the application is scanning files and showing the user which file is currently being checked for duplicates.

7. Stop Button: Below the file path, there is a "Stop" button with a rectangle shape and dark gray background, likely to cancel or halt the scanning process.

8. Folder Icon and Label: At the lower-left corner of the interface, there is an icon of a folder with a blue label on it saying "Projects". This may indicate the target folder being scanned or the location where duplicates will be managed.

9. Data Found Indicator: At the lower-right corner of the interface, a text reading "4,04 GB Found" can be observed. This indicates the amount of data that has been identified as duplicates so far.

The overall impression is that this application is a tool used to identify and manage duplicate files on a system, displaying the progress to the user in real-time along with options to stop the scan and view the amount of storage space occupied by the duplicates found.
