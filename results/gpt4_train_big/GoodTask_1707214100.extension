The image displays a user interface of a task management or reminder application. The UI elements are split into several regions and offer various functionalities:

**Top-left window controls:**
- Three dots for window management (red, yellow, green).

**Left sidebar - Smart Lists and Lists:**
- "Smart Lists" dropdown menu with a chevron icon to expand or collapse.
- A series of predefined list filters:
  - "All Lists" with a checkmark icon and the number "2" to signify item count.
  - "Today" with a calendar icon and the number "0" indicating there are no tasks for today.
  - "High Priorities" with a warning triangle icon and the number "0".
  - "Overdue" with a warning exclamation mark and the number "1" hinting at one overdue task.
  - "Within 3 days" with what appears to be a calendar icon and the number "1".
  - "Recent" with a star icon and the number "2".
  - "#Later" with a marker or tag icon and the number "0".
  - "5 Scheduled tasks" with a numbered list icon and the number "2".
  - "10 Recently Completed Tasks" with a checkmark box icon and the number "0".
- "Lists" dropdown menu with a chevron and one user-defined list:
  - "Reminders" with a list icon and the number "2".

**Bottom-left toolbar:**
- A "+" button for adding new items.
- Buttons that seem to be for action or view options (unlabeled), styled with icons: pencil, 'greater than' arrow, number '6', right double-arrow, and three vertical dots suggesting additional options or settings.

**Central pane - Tasks summary:**
- At the top of this pane, there are three segments:
  - "0" which indicates the number of tasks in this category.
  - "Later" which is presumably the selected list or filter name.
  - "1" possibly indicating the number of tasks without due dates.
- Underneath this header, there is a task entry:
  - A circular checkbox indicating an incomplete task.
  - The task name "dinner".
  - To the right of the task name, the due date and time "Sun, 18 February, 19:00" with a checkmark suggesting it's scheduled or confirmed.

**Bottom-right toolbar:**
- A "+" button, likely for adding new tasks under the "Reminders" category.
