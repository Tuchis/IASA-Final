The image displays a user interface that appears to be from a digital planner or calendar application with a focus on a weekly view. It's a minimalistic design with a light background, primarily using shades of black and grey for text and icons. Here's a detailed description of the UI elements present:

1. Window controls: At the top left corner, there are three circular window control buttons typically seen on macOS applications (red, yellow, and green), suggesting that this app is running on a Mac.

2. Weekly Navigation Bar: Just below the window controls, aligned to the left, is the text "7-Day" which likely indicates the current view is a 7-day or weekly overview.

3. Day Entries:
   - Each day of the week is listed in numeric and day format, starting with "6 Tuesday" and ending with "11 Sunday," suggesting that the dates for this weekly view range from the 6th of a month to the 11th.
   - Each day has a text area underneath where a user can presumably type in activities, notes, or events for that day. The placeholder text in each of these fields is "Type something, or insert a," followed by an icon and the word "Template."
   - The icon next to the word "Template" appears to be a document, indicating that users have the option to insert a preset template for their daily entries.
   - There is a visible text cursor in the text field under "7 Wednesday," indicating it's currently active and ready for input.

4. Horizontal Lines: Each day is separated by a horizontal line, possibly serving as visual dividers to help users distinguish between different days of the week.

5. Arrows for Navigation: In the upper right corner, there are two arrow icons (left and right) that likely serve to navigate between different weeks in the planner.

There are no other visible buttons, menus, or interactive elements in the portion of the interface that is shown in the image. It's worth noting that we might not see some elements which could be part of a larger UI, as this image shows only a portion of the application's interface.
