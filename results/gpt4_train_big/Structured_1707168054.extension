The UI interface displayed is a settings menu for an app called "Structured Pro." Here are the details of each UI element:

1. Top Menu:
   - On the top left, there is a back navigation button (<) labeled with "February 2024" indicating it might return to a monthly view.
   - The central title of the menu is "Settings."
   - On the top right is a "Done" button, typically used to save settings or indicate completion of the changes and exit the settings menu.

2. A red banner at the top with the text "Thanks for using Structured Pro" which appears to be a gratitude message or a premium service identifier.

3. Under the General section, there are four configurable options:
   - "Notifications & Alerts" with a toggle switched to the Off position.
   - "Appearance" option leads to further customization with a ">" indicating more options.
   - "iCloud Sync" also has a ">" suggesting additional settings.
   - "Advanced" option with a ">" for more advanced settings.

4. Integrations section:
   - "Calendars" with text "Permission Required" and a ">" indicating action is needed to enable integration.
   - "Reminders" is similar to Calendars with "Permission Required" and a ">".

5. Support section:
   - "Help & Feedback" option with a ">" to access support resources.

6. Get Structured Everywhere:
   - This appears to be an option or an ad suggesting the app is available on multiple platforms, feature, or subscription service with a ">" for more details.

7. Follow Us:
   - This is likely a footer section where you can follow the app on various social media platforms, but the specific platforms are not listed.

8. At the bottom right, there's a circular button with a "+" sign, usually indicating an option to add new items or create something new within the app.

9. Background Context:
   - The background shows partial views of a calendar with days and months visible. It shows "Mon 12", "Tue 13", and "Sun 18". This might reflect the application's function as a calendar or scheduling tool.

10. Other UI Elements:
   - There are three dots at the top center, often indicative of a tutorial or a slide indicator to suggest there are multiple pages or steps.
   - On the top right, there are three parallel horizontal lines (a menu icon) and gear icon, typically representing a settings menu, but here they may be inactive as they are faded compared to other active UI elements.

These elements make up the main interaction points within the settings menu of the Structured Pro app.
