This image shows a computer interface of an application with a focus on an import functionality. The UI is divided into three main columns: a sidebar, main content area, and a side information panel.

Starting from the top left, the interface features the standard window control buttons for closing, minimizing, and full-screening the window. They are colored red, yellow, and green respectively. Below these control buttons is a search bar, labeled with a magnifying glass icon and the placeholder text "Filter."

Below the search bar is the sidebar menu with the following sections and options, highlighted in various shades of gray and blue:
- LIBRARY (in capital letters, indicating a section header)
  - Start (button)
  - Import (button, currently highlighted in blue to indicate it is selected)
  - Export (button)
  - Remove (button)
- CLEANER GROUPS (section header)
- CUSTOM CLEANERS (section header)
At the bottom of the sidebar, there are two icons: a "+" (plus) sign and a grid-like icon, which could be for adding new items or accessing additional settings.

The main content area is titled "Import" at the top and contains instructions for the user: "Select the files to import. Review the cleaners contained within the files. Select desired cleaners and click 'Import Selected'." It also includes a "Select Files..." button in the upper right corner, presumably to begin the import process by selecting files from the user's computer.

Below the instructions is a large, empty list area with horizontal lines suggesting where listed items would appear once files are selected for import. This space likely populates with details about the files chosen by a user.

On the right side of the interface is a side information panel with a checkbox option saying "Replace existing cleaners without prompts" indicating a setting related to the import process where existing items may be overwritten without additional warnings or confirmations.

At the bottom of this panel there is a button labeled "Import Selected," which is likely used to finalize the import of the selected cleaners once they have been reviewed.

The UI's color scheme includes a mix of grays, whites, and blues, indicating different states of the interface elements, such as the currently active tab or button. The design is clean and suggests a minimalistic and straightforward user experience.
