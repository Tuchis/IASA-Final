The UI interface displayed in the image appears to be from a break management app and is divided into two primary sections: the left sidebar menu and the main content area on the right. 

**Left Sidebar Menu:**
- The top left corner has typical window control buttons: red, yellow, and green, which are used to close, minimize, and maximize the window respectively.
- Below that is a navigation menu with icons representing different sections of the app:
  1. Activity (selected) - represented by a clipboard icon.
  2. General - represented by a gear icon.
  3. Shortcuts - represented by a keyboard key icon.
  4. Exclusions - represented by a crossed circle.
  5. Updates - represented by a circular arrow, suggesting update-related settings.
  6. Advanced - represented by a cog and wrench.

Under the 'Activity' section, which is currently active, there are two categories of breaks listed:
- Normal: Displays a status indication with a red dot followed by the text "due in 49 min, 3 secs" and "new break", and there's an instruction "click to configure break".
- Micro: Shows a status indication with a green dot followed by the text "due in 13 min, 48 secs" and "new break", with the same instruction "click to configure break".

Below the breaks, there is an 'Options' title followed by the menu sections listed above.

**Main Content Area (Shortcuts Section):**
- At the top, there's a heading that reads "Optional keyboard shortcuts that work from any app."
- Below the heading is a list of actions with corresponding empty text fields and 'Record Shortcut' buttons for users to assign custom keyboard shortcuts. The actions are as follows:
  1. Start Normal Break
  2. Start Micro Break
  3. Start Next Break
  4. Postpone Next Break (1)
  5. Postpone Next Break (2)
  6. Skip Next / Current Break
  7. Pause All Indefinitely
  8. Resume All Breaks
  9. Reset All Breaks
  10. Stop Sound

No shortcuts have been set, as indicated by the empty fields next to each action.

Each action has a blank space, presumably for displaying the shortcut once recorded, and they each have an accompanying "Record Shortcut" button, which users would presumably click to set a shortcut.

Overall, the UI seems straightforward and functional, meant for managing work breaks and setting up keyboard shortcuts to control these breaks within the app.
