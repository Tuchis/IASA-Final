The UI interface you have provided is from an image editing application named TouchRetouch. The interface elements are laid out as follows:

Top Menu Bar:
- On the top left, there is a "OPEN" button symbolized with a folder icon, indicating that the user can open files or images through this button.
- Next to the "OPEN" button, there is a magnification percentage indicator displaying "64%", which shows the current zoom level of the image in the workspace.
- To the right of the zoom level, there is a fit-to-screen option denoted by "[ Fit ]", which seems to adjust the image view to fit the screen.
- In the center, there is a filename label that reads "TouchRetouch â€“ 547875140019.jpg," which indicates the name of the current image file being edited.
- On the top right of the interface, there is a series of utility buttons: 
   - "Compare", depicted with a "< >" icon, likely lets the user compare the edited image with the original.
   - "Undo" is symbolized by a curved left arrow and serves to revert the last action taken.
   - "Redo" is indicated by a curved right arrow and allows the user to redo an action they have undone.
   - "History" is represented by a clockwise spiral arrow, suggesting it could open a history panel showing past actions.
   - "EXPORT" is the last button, clearly intended to save or export the edited image.

Main Editing Tools:
- Along the bottom of the UI, there is a toolbar with several editing tools:
   - "OBJECT REMOVAL", which is currently selected as indicated by its green color, is for removing unwanted elements from the image.
   - "QUICK REPAIR" is another tool likely used for rapid fixes or corrections.
   - "LINE REMOVAL" would be for removing lines or scratches.
   - "CLONE STAMP" is a common tool for duplicating parts of the image.
   - "TONE & COLOR" might be used for adjusting the image's tone and color settings.
   - "CROP" signifies a tool for cropping the image to a desired size or aspect ratio.

On the far right, there is a slider with a label indicating "Line thickness". The slider may be used to adjust the thickness of the line when using tools like line removal.

Workspace:
- The workspace takes up most of the interface, showcasing the image being edited. The image depicts a scene with the "SOUTHBANK CENTRE" building and some surroundings including a staircase, trees, and a clear sky. Information like the event "IMAGINE CHILDREN'S FESTIVAL" is displayed on a banner within the picture.

Please note that since this is a static image, no interactions with the UI are possible, and I have described the elements based solely on their appearance.
