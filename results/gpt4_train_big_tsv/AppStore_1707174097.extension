The UI interface appears to be from an application store designed for a desktop operating system. The overall layout is divided into two main panels: a navigation sidebar on the left and a content area on the right.

**Left Sidebar:**
- At the top, there are three colored dots suggesting the window controls for close, minimize, and maximize.
- Below that is a search bar with a magnifying glass icon and the placeholder text "Search."
- A menu list follows with several options each with an icon and text:
  - Discover
  - Arcade
  - Create (selected/hightlighted indicating current view)
  - Work
  - Play
  - Develop
  - Categories
  - Updates (has a badge with the number 5, indicating there are five updates available)

**Right Content Area:**
- The large header 'Create' signals the current section.
- Below the header are two content blocks each with a heading:

  1. "GET STARTED" block:
     - Subtitle: "Sketch on paper, polish on Mac"
     - Description: "Linearity Curve turns drawings into vectors."
     - This block has an elaborate illustration depicting three characters being creative with paper and digital devices. 

  2. "APPS WE LOVE" block:
     - Subtitle: "Find your groove"
     - Description: "Mixing app Djay will rock your next party."
     - There is a graphical representation of a turntable or music mixing interface.

- Additionally, below both these blocks is a section titled “Great New Creative Apps and Updates” featuring a horizontal list of apps:
  - Each app representation in the list includes:
    - An app icon.
    - The app name and a brief description.
    - A button that either says "Get" indicating the app can be downloaded for free or displays the price (for example "£14.99" or "£199.99") indicating that the app must be purchased. Some buttons indicate "In-App Purchases" suggesting additional content or services available within the app for extra cost.
  - To the right of this section is a "See All" link, presumably to browse more apps in this category.

**Bottom Left Corner:**
- An element, likely the profile or account section, with a horizontal bar pattern and the name "Mariya Hirna."

**Overall Context:**
- The interface is likely for a curated section of the application store, focused on creative tools and resources, according to the highlighted "Create" section and the nature of the listed apps.
- The UI suggests a user-friendly approach with easily recognizable icons and a clean layout for exploring and downloading apps.

Please note that due to the constraints, I have not identified any potentially recognisable trademarks or logos.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
