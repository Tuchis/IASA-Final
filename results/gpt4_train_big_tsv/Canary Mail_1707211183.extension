This is an image of a mobile app user interface with the following elements:

1. Status bar (top of the screen): This includes three icons that probably indicate battery life, signal strength, and Wi-Fi connectivity on the left side, as well as some dots on the right that likely represent the strength of the cellular signal or possibly notifications.

2. Page indicators: Just below the status bar, there are three dots aligned horizontally in the center, suggesting multiple pages or screens within the app that can be navigated.

3. Main Title: Centrally located on the screen, in bold blue text, it reads "Let AI Write Your Emails."

4. Subtitle/Description: Below the main title, there is a text that says "Let Canary magically write or reply to emails on your behalf."

5. Instructions: Under the description, it indicates "Select an option to try it now:"

6. First option field: Contains the pre-written prompt, "Congratulate Neil for landing on the Moon!" It is enclosed in a blue outline, implying that it is currently selected or highlighted.

7. Second option field: Below the first, thereâ€™s another prompt which reads "Email boss, say I quit. Make it funny." This field has a grey outline.

8. Text input field: A grey-bordered box with placeholder text that states "Enter prompt here..." for the user to input their own email content prompt.

9. 'Write Email' button: At the bottom, there's a pill-shaped blue button that has a sparkle emoji followed by the text "Write Email," suggesting that clicking this button will initiate the email writing process based on the selected or entered prompt.

10. Arrow button: To the right of the 'Write Email' button is a circular icon with a right-pointing arrow inside it, which appears to be a navigation control, possibly to go to the next screen or step in the process.

The general context suggested by this interface is that it is part of an email application, possibly named "Canary," which has features powered by AI to help users write or generate email content. Users can select from suggested prompts or enter a custom prompt to have an AI generate an email for them.
