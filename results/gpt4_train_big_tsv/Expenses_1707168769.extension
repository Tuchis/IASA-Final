Sure! In the image, we see a user interface (UI) likely belonging to a financial or budgeting application. The UI elements are arranged within a window that presents a dialog for creating or editing a 'New Sheet'. Here is a detailed description of the elements:

1. Window Title: At the top of the window, there is a title reading "New Sheet".

2. Navigation Controls:
   - At the top left corner, there is a "Cancel" button, suggesting the user can cancel the current operation or dialog.
   - At the top right corner, there is a "Done" button, likely to save changes or confirm the creation of a new sheet.

3. Sheet Naming Field:
   - In the central upper part of the sheet dialog, there is a text input field with the placeholder text "untitled sheet", where a user can enter the name of the new sheet.
   - Next to the naming field, there is a “close” or “clear” icon ('x'), indicating that the user can clear the entered text.

4. Currency Selection:
   - Below the sheet naming field, there is a labeled circular icon with "UAH" inside it, suggesting it might be an abbreviation for the Ukrainian Hryvnia currency.
   - Adjacent to the circular icon is a dropdown selector with the label "Ukrainian Hryvnia" and a downward arrow, indicating that the user can tap to select a different currency.

5. Advanced Settings Section:
   - Right below the currency selector are two options with checkboxes inside toggle switches, implying these are settings that can be turned on or off.
   - The first option is labeled "Show Total Balance" and the second option is "Show Currency Selection". Both options have a checkmark inside the toggle switch, meaning they are currently activated.

6. Bottom Text and Button:
   - At the bottom left of the window, there is a text stating "Select New Sheet to create a new sheet."
   - In the bottom left corner of the window, there is a "+" icon with the label "New Sheet" next to it. This likely allows the user to initiate the creation of another new sheet.

Lastly, there are system or app control icons at the very top left of the image representing window actions (minimize, maximize, close), a fold-like icon suggesting collapsing the window on the left of the screen, and the generic "Search" magnifying glass icon on the top right, indicating the possibility to search through the app or documents.

The UI elements are styled in a clean, minimalist design with a neutral color scheme, characteristic of contemporary software applications focusing on user experience and clarity.
