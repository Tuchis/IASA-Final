   - There are three small icons or buttons near the top left corner resembling circular dots, signifying a common design for menu access or window control on desktop interfaces.
   - Below is a highlighted menu item labeled **"Planner"**. It is likely that this is the currently active section in the application.

2. **Bottom Sidebar Area (Left-hand side)**:
   - Bottom left corner has a label with a symbol that looks like a document or sheet and text **"New Sheet"**, suggesting a button for creating a new sheet or entry.

4. **Category Selection Pop-up (Right-hand side)**:
   - The pop-up is titled **"Select a category"**.
   - A search input field at the top of the pop-up, with a magnifying glass icon indicating it's for searching categories.

   - A button with a check mark, typically indicating that the user can confirm or save their current selection.

6. **Top Menu Bar (Very top of the UI)**:
   - There is a "+" sign, probably for adding new items or transactions.
