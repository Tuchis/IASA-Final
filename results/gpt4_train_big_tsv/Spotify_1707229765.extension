The image shows a user interface of a music streaming application. Here's a detailed description of each visible element starting from the top-left corner and moving towards the bottom-right of the interface:

1. Window Control Buttons: These are the red, yellow, and green buttons typically found on a macOS to close, minimize, and maximize the application window, respectively.

2. Sidebar Menu: A vertical navigation bar on the left edge of the UI which includes icons that likely represent different sections of the app such as Home, Search, Your Library, and probably some user-specific collections or features.

3. Main Navigation:
   - Back and Forward Arrows: To navigate through previously viewed screens.
   - Search Field: Contains the text "dakh", which suggests that a search has been made. There's an 'X' on the right, indicating an option to clear the search field.
   - Profile and Settings Area: An icon resembling a silhouette for user profile access, and icons for further application settings or options. The letter 'M' inside a circle possibly indicates active user account initial.

4. Sub-Navigation Tabs: Tabs for filtering search results – "All", "Artists", "Songs", "Albums", "Playlists", "Profiles", "Podcasts & Shows". The "All" tab is highlighted, suggesting it's the current view.

5. Main Content Area: Divided into two sections, 'Top result' and 'Songs'.
   - Top Result: Showcases an artist, "Dakh Daughters," with an image likely representing album art or artist profile. The term 'Artist' underneath confirms the type of result.
   - Songs List: Shows a list of songs, each with a thumbnail (probably album art), song title, artist name, and song duration. In descending order, the songs listed are "Rozy," "Людина," "Папiроси," and "Inshe Misto," all by Dakh Daughters. The song "Inshe Misto" is marked with a green check, possibly indicating it's been downloaded, added to the library, or currently playing.

6. Left Sidebar Bottom: Additional icons that may represent different functionalities or services within the app. There's a dot indicator under the third icon from the top, which could signify that the corresponding section is active.

7. Main Control Bar: Includes globally used controls for the application such as playing music, volume control – 
   - Play/Pause, Skip, and Repeat: Situated in the central part, these controls are for playing and managing music playback.
   - Queue and Devices: Icons suggest features to view the queue of songs and select playback devices.
   - Volume Slider: With a speaker icon to its left, indicating that it's meant for adjusting the volume.

The UI elements are laid out on a dark theme, which is characteristic of many modern music applications, with the main sections being clearly distinguishable.

The layout supports user interaction for tasks like searching, browsing, and controlling music playback.
