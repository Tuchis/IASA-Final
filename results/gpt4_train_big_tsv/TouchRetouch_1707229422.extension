The UI interface you have provided is from an image editing application named TouchRetouch. The interface elements are laid out as follows:

Top Menu Bar:
- On the top left, there is a "OPEN" button symbolized with a folder icon, indicating that the user can open files or images through this button.
- Next to the "OPEN" button, there is a magnification percentage indicator displaying "64%", which shows the current zoom level of the image in the workspace.
- To the right of the zoom level, there is a fit-to-screen option denoted by "[ Fit ]", which seems to adjust the image view to fit the screen.
- In the center, there is a filename label that reads "TouchRetouch â€“ 547875140019.jpg," which indicates the name of the current image file being edited.
- On the top right of the interface, there is a series of utility buttons: 
   - "Compare", depicted with a "< >" icon, likely lets the user compare the edited image with the original.
   - "Undo" is symbolized by a curved left arrow and serves to revert the last action taken.
   - "Redo" is indicated by a curved right arrow and allows the user to redo an action they have undone.
   - "History" is represented by a clockwise spiral arrow, suggesting it could open a history panel showing past actions.
   - "EXPORT" is the last button, clearly intended to save or export the edited image.

Main Editing Tools:
- Along the bottom of the UI, there is a toolbar with several editing tools:
   - "OBJECT REMOVAL", which is currently selected as indicated by its green color, is for removing unwanted elements from the image.
   - "QUICK REPAIR" is another tool likely used for rapid fixes or corrections.
   - "LINE REMOVAL" would be for removing lines or scratches.
   - "CLONE STAMP" is a common tool for duplicating parts of the image.
   - "TONE & COLOR" might be used for adjusting the image's tone and color settings.
   - "CROP" signifies a tool for cropping the image to a desired size or aspect ratio.

On the far right, there is a slider with a label indicating "Line thickness". The slider may be used to adjust the thickness of the line when using tools like line removal.

Workspace:
- The workspace takes up most of the interface, showcasing the image being edited. The image depicts a scene with the "SOUTHBANK CENTRE" building and some surroundings including a staircase, trees, and a clear sky. Information like the event "IMAGINE CHILDREN'S FESTIVAL" is displayed on a banner within the picture.

Please note that since this is a static image, no interactions with the UI are possible, and I have described the elements based solely on their appearance.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
