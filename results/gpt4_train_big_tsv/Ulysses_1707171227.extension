  - Last 7 Days
  - Trash
  
- Projects Section with a folder named "New Project...".

**Right Panel (Document Editor)**
- The top of this panel shows a search icon, sharing options, and more options represented by an ellipsis.
- There's a word count in the upper right corner indicating "835 Words".
- Title of the document: "## A Voyage to Lilliput"
- An image with a caption: The image depicts a scene from the book "Gulliver's Travels".
- The document text below the title and image reads:
  "It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen's Land. _FN_ Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food; the rest were in a very weak condition. On the 5th of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within half a cable's length of the ship; but the wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock. We rowed, by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the ship, I cannot tell; but I conclude they were all lost."

Each element in the UI corresponds with a functionality expected in an application designed for managing and editing documents. The left panel is for navigation, the middle for document selection, and the right for content editing.
