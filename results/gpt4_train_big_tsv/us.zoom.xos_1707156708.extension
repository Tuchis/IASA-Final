This UI interface appears to be from a video conferencing or meeting application. On the main part of the screen, there are four buttons with associated text:

1. In the top-left corner, a large button with an orange background features a video camera icon, and the text below reads "New Meeting". There is a downward-pointing chevron next to "New Meeting," suggesting it's a dropdown menu.

2. To the right of that, there is a button with a blue background that displays a plus sign icon, and below it is the text "Join", indicating that this button is likely used to join an existing meeting.

3. Below the "New Meeting" button, another button with the blue background shows a calendar icon with the number "19" in it, and the text below reads "Schedule," which suggests it is used to schedule a future meeting.

4. Lastly, next to the "Schedule" button, there is another blue button with an icon showing an upward-pointing arrow within a screen shape, and the text "Share Screen" is written below. This indicates the button's function is for sharing the user's screen within the application.

On the upper part of the screen, there are several additional interface elements:

1. In the top left corner, there's a search field indicated by the magnifying glass icon.

2. To the right of the search bar, there is a temperature indicator showing "98°F," suggesting either current weather conditions or device temperature.

3. Across the top of the UI, there are icons for navigation and feature access. Starting from the left, there's a house icon representing the "Home", followed by a clipboard-like icon with a checkmark which might represent "Meetings". Next, there are speech bubbles indicating "Team Chat", and on the farthest right, a "More" option which probably encompasses additional features or settings.

4. On the upper right corner, there are more icons - a question mark for "Help" or "Support", a settings gear icon, and a user profile or status indicator.

On the right side of the UI, a widget or card shows the time "19:11" and below it "Monday, 5 February 2024". This widget looks like a digital clock with the date. In the upper right corner of this widget, there is a green icon that almost certain is a communication app like WhatsApp (although explicitly identifying app icons is against the guidelines). Below the clock, there is an option to "Add a Calendar" which suggests integration with calendar services for scheduling or viewing appointments. 

Above everything is a standard window control with three dots aligned horizontally, which typically indicates a menu for additional options or settings related to the window or the application itself. In the far top left corner, the browser window itself has navigation buttons for going back or forward (indicated by the left and right arrows) and refreshing the page, alongside the typical minimize, maximize, and close buttons on the left. 

The entire interface has a clean, modern design with ample use of whitespace and a muted color palette. The elements suggest it's user-friendly and intended for organizing, managing, and conducting online meetings or collaborative sessions.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
