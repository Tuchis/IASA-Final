The image displays a user interface that appears to be from an app store on a computer operating system. The UI elements are divided among three sections: the top bar, the sidebar on the left, and the main content area.

Top Bar:
- Three colored dots on the top left, typically representing window controls for close (red), minimize (yellow), and maximize/restore (green).
- A search field with a magnifying glass icon and the placeholder text "Search".

Sidebar (navigation pane):
- A series of items with icons and labels: "Discover", "Arcade", "Create", "Work", "Play", "Develop", "Categories" (selected), and "Updates" (the latter has a badge with the number '5').
- The name "Mariya Hirna" is displayed at the bottom of the sidebar with a user icon preceding it, indicating a user profile section or account information.

Main Content Area:
- A header titled "Categories" with a list of categories each accompanied by an icon. These categories are: "Business," "Entertainment," "Graphics & Design," "Medical," "Photo & Video," "Safari Extensions," "Travel," "Developer Tools," "Finance," "Health & Fitness," "Music," "Productivity," "Social Networking," "Utilities," "Education," "Games," "Lifestyle," "News," "Reference," "Sports," and "Weather."
- A subheader titled "Editors' Choice," which lists a selection of apps with their logo, name, and a brief description or tagline. For each app, there is also a price or action button:
  - "Photomator" with the tagline "Your photo editing powerhouse" and a "Get" button indicating it might be a free app with in-app purchases.
  - "Things 3" with the tagline "Organize your life" and a displayed price of £49.99.
  - "Pixelmator Pro" with the tagline "Pro image editing for everyone" and a displayed price of £49.99.
  - "Acorn 7" with the tagline "Image editing for humans" and a displayed price of £29.99.
  - "Drafts" with the tagline "Where text starts" and a "Get" button indicating it might be a free app with in-app purchases.
  - "Adobe Lightroom" with no tagline visible and a "Get" button indicating it might be a free app with in-app purchases.

In the top right corner of the "Editors' Choice" section, there is a "See All" link that likely allows users to view the full list of editors' choice apps.
