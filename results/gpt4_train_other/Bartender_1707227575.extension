The UI interface in the image is from "Bartender 5," an application that appears to manage menu bar items on a Mac operating system.

On the left side of the interface, there is a vertical navigation bar with the following items and associated icons:

1. General (a gear icon)
2. Menu Bar Items (three horizontal lines with dots on the side)
3. Menu Bar Style (three circles configured in a triangular fashion)
4. Presets (an icon with two squares and an arrow)
5. Triggers (a lightning bolt icon) â€“ This item is currently selected, as indicated by the grey highlighting.
6. Hotkeys (a keyboard icon)
7. Advanced (a gear icon with additional smaller gears)
8. About (an information "i" inside a circle icon)

On the top left, there are three small dots - red, yellow, green - which are standard on Mac applications for closing, minimizing, and maximizing the window, respectively.

In the main content area to the right, there is a header titled "Triggers" with a subtitle that reads, "Add triggers to activate a preset, show menu bar items when trigger conditions are met." Below the subtitle, there is a toggle switch labeled "Triggers Enabled" that is currently in the 'on' position, as indicated by the toggle being to the right and filled in blue.

Beneath the header are three listed trigger conditions:

1. "Show Battery when battery condition met" - with a battery icon to the left, a checkbox (currently unchecked) and a "Settings" button to the right along with an inactive toggle switched to the off position.
2. "Show Time Machine when time machine is backing up." - with a clock icon to the left, a checkbox (currently unchecked) and a "Settings" button to the right along with an inactive toggle switched to the off position.
3. "Show Wi-Fi when Wi-Fi condition met" - with a Wi-Fi icon to the left, a checkbox (currently unchecked) and a "Settings" button to the right along with an inactive toggle switched to the off position.

Immediately below these conditions, there is a plus icon encased in a circle, which presumably is used to add new triggers.

At the very bottom, there are two buttons side by side, "Delete Trigger" and "Add Trigger." They appear to be in a deactivated state, which could mean no triggers are selected for these actions to be applicable.
