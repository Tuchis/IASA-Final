The user interface in the image appears to be that of a calendar or scheduling application. Here's the breakdown of various UI elements visible in the image:

### Left Panel:
- Top-left corner contains navigation menu buttons.
- There are tabs for the calendar view with options for "Day," "Week," "Month," and "Year."
- Below is the main portion of the left panel which shows a day's view, "6 February 2024, Tuesday," with hourly time slots from "08:00" to "19:00". Hours are listed along the left column.
- A blue rectangle spans from "12:00" to just before "14:00" with text "12:00 New Event".

### Right Panel:
- Top-right corner has a search field indicated by the magnifying glass icon and the text field "Search."
- Below the search bar is a mini-month calendar view for February 2024, with days of the week from "Sunday" to "Saturday" on top. Today's date is highlighted with a red circle around "6."
- There's a "Today" button on the top-right corner of the calendar view.
- Below is an option to toggle the location visibility, denoted by a house icon and toggle switch, currently set to "Home."
- A detailed view of the "New Event" selected on the left panel is shown here, beginning with the highlighted title "New Event".
- Underneath, there are fields/options to "Add Location or Video Call," a loudspeaker icon, and options for "Tuesday, 6 Feb," "Add Alert, Repeat or Travel Time," which include the times "12:00 to 14:00."
- Additional fields/options to "Add Invitees" and "Add Notes, URL or Attachments" are also visible.

No actual text content seems to be entered into the text fields except for the default placeholder text or suggestions for action, like "Add Location or Video Call" or "Add Notes, URL or Attachments." The visual representation of the UI is very clean and organized, likely aimed at providing a user-friendly experience for scheduling and event management.
