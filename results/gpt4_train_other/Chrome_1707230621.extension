The interface shown in the image is from a Google Chrome browser's settings page, specifically the section for customizing a user profile.

Starting from the left sidebar, we have:

1. The sidebar includes the following options:
   - You and Google
   - Autofill and passwords
   - Privacy and security
   - Performance
   - Appearance
   - Search engine
   - Default browser
   - On start-up
   - Languages
   - Downloads
   - Accessibility
   - System
   - Reset settings
   - Extensions (with an icon indicating external link)
   - About Chrome

Moving on to the main content area:

2. At the top left, there's a back arrow labeled "Customize profile."
3. Below that, there is a field labeled "Name your Chrome profile" pre-filled with "Person 1."
4. Below the name field, there's a section titled "Pick a theme color," with a selection of colors arranged in a 4x4 grid format, one of which is currently selected (black/blue combination with a check mark).
5. Underneath the color options, there's another section titled "Pick an avatar," displaying a variety of profile icons in a circular format, arranged in rows. Some depict abstract shapes and designs, while others portray animals like a fox, tiger, and a snake.

In the top right corner of the screen, we can see the browser controls, including navigation buttons (back, forward, reload), address bar, bookmarks bar, and profile icon with the current user labeled "Person 1" on the rightmost side.

Lastly, the browser tabs at the top of the interface show that there are two opened tabs; one titled "What's new" which seems to be on the active tab, and the other is the current tab with "Settings - Customize profile".

The URL field clearly displays "chrome://settings/manageProfile," which is the address of the Chrome settings page for profile management.

The rest of the environment includes the operating system's window control buttons (minimize, maximize/restore, close) in the top left corner and some pinned tabs in the browser bar with icons for Gmail, YouTube, Maps, and more.
