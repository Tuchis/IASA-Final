This image shows a user interface for what appears to be a theme selection screen within an app.

At the top, we have a header or toolbar with icons and text:

1. A Navbar with various icons indicating possible features or sections of the application such as:
   - Calendars
   - Markdown
   - Todo
   - Editor
   - Themes
   - AI & Plugins
   - Sync
   - Shortcuts
   - Files
   - License
2. The word "Preferences" to the right, which is likely clickable and opens up the applicationâ€™s settings or preferences panel.

Directly to the right of the Preferences button, there is an Import button:
- "Import Theme..." suggests a functionality to add or customize themes from an external source.

Below that, there appears to be a title or instruction:
- "How to create a custom theme?" which might be a hyperlink or a dropdown that provides additional information on theme customization.

The main section below shows several theme options with example content:

1. The "Orange" theme on the left has a border highlighting it, suggesting it's selected or currently active. Each theme preview seems to contain the same example content:
   - A radio button (unselected)
   - The text "Hello World, this is a @task"
   - A bullet point containing "With some bold and italic text"
   - A blockquote symbol followed by "And brave [links](#) inside a quote"

2. The other theme examples visible are:
   - "Toothbleach"
   - "Toothbleach Condensed"
   - "Solarized Light"
   - "Breakers"
   - "Contrast"

Each of these theme examples has the same example content mentioned above with stylistic differences in font, weight, and colors to distinguish each theme from one another.

The UI design indicates that this app may be used for taking notes or managing tasks, and it provides a visual way for users to select how their interface looks in terms of color and typography.
