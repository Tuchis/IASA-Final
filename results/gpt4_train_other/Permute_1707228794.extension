The UI interface in the image belongs to an application named "Permute." Here is a description of the various elements visible:

- Window Controls at the very top left: These are the standard three-colored buttons typically found on macOS applications. The red button is used to close the window, the yellow to minimize it, and the green to maximize or enter full-screen mode.
  
- Application Name: "Permute" is displayed at the top center of the window, indicating the name of the application.

- Central Graphic: There is a large, central graphic that appears to be a stylized representation of a media file, such as audio or video, given that it has a waveform and what might resemble a film perforation edge.

- Text Field at the bottom center: The text within the field reads "No Conversions," which likely indicates that there are currently no file conversion tasks running or queued within the application.

- Buttons at the bottom:
  - A "+" button on the bottom left to add files for conversion.
  - A gear icon next to it, likely representing settings or preferences options.
  - A play button with a circular arrow around it on the bottom right, which suggests it's for starting conversions or perhaps retrying failed ones.
  - An information "i" icon, which commonly indicates a place to find more information or details.
  - A hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) or options icon which usually implies additional functions or settings beyond the primary interface.

Across the bottom of the window, there's a subtle dividing line separating the main panel from the lower button area. The overall aesthetic is minimalistic and modern, fitting with many macOS applications.
