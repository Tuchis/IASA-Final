This image shows the user interface of a calculator or conversion application. Here are the UI elements as visible in the image:

On the very top, we have the window control buttons typical for macOS: red, yellow, and green dots which represent close, minimize, and maximize/resize respectively.

The interface includes a two-column layout:

On the left-side column, there are inputs — these are probably areas where the user can type in the calculations or conversions they want to perform. The text fields contain the following entries:

1. "Convert between volume and mass for many common cooking ingredients" (this looks like a section title rather than an input)
2. "1 cup nutella in grams"
3. "200 grams butter in cups"
4. (Blank line)
5. "3 km + 10 m"
6. "3.01 km"
7. (Blank line)
8. "€30 + $20"

On the right-side column, the results of the conversions/calculations are displayed. They align with the left-side inputs as follows:

- "298.10117799 g" (presumably the result for 1 cup of Nutella in grams)
- "0.881057 cup" (presumably the result for 200 grams of butter in cups)
- (Blank corresponding to line 4)
- "3.01 km" (result for adding 10 meters to 3 kilometers)
- "3.01 km" (not clear why this is repeated — may be an error or placeholder)
- (Blank corresponding to line 7)
- "$52.22" (apparently the result of adding €30 and $20, possibly using a currency conversion rate)

At the bottom of the right-side column, there's a grayed-out element with a button appearance that states "Total $52.22," which seems like a summary of some of the calculations above or a different calculation not shown in the visible entries.

It's worth noting that from this UI, it's not clear how the user interacts with the application beyond typing in the fields. There are no visible buttons, menu options, or other means of interaction obvious in the image provided.
