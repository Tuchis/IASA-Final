You're looking at a UI interface of an app with the following elements and text fields:

On the top left, there are three colored dots — red, yellow, and green, typically used to close, minimize, and maximize a window on macOS.

Below that, on the left-hand side, is the sidebar navigation panel containing the following items:
1. General (with gear icon before the text)
2. Windows (highlighted in blue with a screen icon before the text, indicating the current section selected)
3. Snapping (with a screen icon before the text)
4. Apps (with a screen icon before the text)
5. Menubar (with a screen icon before the text)
6. Advanced (with a gear icon before the text)
7. About (with an information 'i' icon before the text)

On the top right corner of the window is a "Quit" button, which probably exits the application.

The main content panel to the right of the sidebar shows the title "Windows" with a subtitle text that reads, "Control basic functionality by swiping and pinching on window titlebars."

Below the title are the following settings with checkboxes, text descriptions, and illustrative icons:

1. "Mission Control" (checkbox checked) — "Most Window and Snapping gestures also work in Mission Control & App Exposé."
2. "General Modifier" with a dropdown arrow, set to "^" (symbol representing the Control key on a keyboard).

Listed below are several actions with associated gestures and keyboard shortcuts:

- "Quit" — Red 'x' icon — Pinch in twice to quit an application. Shortcut: "⌘↓"
- "Close" — Red 'x' icon — Pinch in once to close a window. Shortcut: "⌘↓"
- "Minimize" — Yellow '-' icon — Swipe down once to minimize a window. Shortcut: "⤵︎↓"
- "Fullscreen" — Green '+' icon — Pinch out or tap, hold and swipe up to enter or exit fullscreen mode. Shortcut: "⤾↑"
- "Hide" — "G⤵︎⤴︎2" shown in symbols, a double tap with the general modifier to hide all windows of an application. Use the secondary modifier to hide all other apps.
- "Spaces" — Blue rectangle icon — Tap, hold and swipe or use the general modifier to move a window between Mission Control spaces. Shortcut: "G⬅➡"

These descriptions and shortcuts provide guidance on how to manipulate windows within the application, including using multiple fingers on a trackpad or mouse (as indicated by the gesture icons) alongside keyboard modifiers and shortcuts.
