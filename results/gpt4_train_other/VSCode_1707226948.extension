The UI interface in the image appears to be a settings menu of a text-editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) application. Here are the elements of the UI from left to right, top to bottom:

On the very top of the window:
- A series of icons on the far left, which are likely for navigation, but their specific functions are not visible.
- A search bar labeled "Search settings" for filtering settings options.
- Tabs depicting the current page (Settings) with a close button to the right of 'Settings'.
- A set of window control buttons on the top right that appear to be for minimizing, maximizing/restoring, and closing the window.
- An account or sync indicator saying, "Last synced: 2 mos ago" with a cloud and sync icon.

On the left sidebar:
- A list of settings categories starting with "User" expanded and subsequent categories like "Text Editor", "Workbench", "Window", "Features", "Application", "Security", "Extensions" which can potentially be expanded (indicated by ">" before the category name).
- It shows that "Text Editor" is the currently selected category and it's expanded to show subcategories such as: Cursor, Find, Font, Formatting, Diff Editor, Minimap, Suggestions, and Files.

In the main content area, divided into sections:
- A header "Text Editor" which is the selected category from the left sidebar.
- A section titled "Accessibility Page Size" with a description "Controls the number of lines in the editor that can be read out by a screen reader at once. When we detect a screen reader we automatically set the default to be 500. Warning: this has a performance implication for numbers larger than the default." Followed by a text field with the value "10".
- Below is a section titled "Accessibility Support" with a description "Controls if the UI should run in a mode where it is optimized for screen readers." with a drop-down menu set to "auto".
- A section titled "Auto Closing Brackets" with a description "Controls whether the editor should automatically close brackets after the user adds an opening bracket." with a drop-down menu set to "languageDefined".
- "Auto Closing Delete" with a description "Controls whether the editor should remove adjacent closing quotes or brackets when deleting." with a drop-down menu set to "auto".
- "Auto Closing Overtype" with a description "Controls whether the editor should type over closing quotes or brackets." 

On the bottom left corner of the window:
- Various status and notification icons which may represent issues, updates, or background tasks.

At the bottom center of the window:
- Icons for various tasks or views related to the software, but without descriptive text, their functions are ambiguous.
- An indicator showing "0" which could represent some countable metric like errors, warnings, or other notifications within the application.

Please note that I cannot interact with or provide specifics beyond the visible interface elements and their descriptions as shown in the image.
