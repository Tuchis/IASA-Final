This image shows the user interface of an app with a focus on templates for document creation or organization. I'll describe the elements from top to bottom and left to right, including buttons and text fields:

### Top Bar
- **Left Side**: Icons representing menu access or navigation (3 horizontal lines, possibly a menu button; 2 squares with lines, possibly a view toggle; left-pointing arrow; right-pointing arrow; magnifying glass, likely a search function).
- **Middle**: The text "Templates" is prominently displayed, indicating the current section of the app.
- **Right Side**: Various icons likely for additional functionality (circle with a "+" inside, indicating a create or new function; pen and square, possibly an edit or write function; grid view toggle; list view toggle; a paintbrush, which might be for customization; three vertical dots, often indicating more options or settings).

### Left Sidebar
- **Top**: A user's initials "Ys" inside a circle, indicating the user profile, followed by the text "Yelyzaveta's Space", suggesting this is a personalized area of the app.
- **Below**: Two icons side by side, one resembles a dashboard or menu (three horizontal bars with a square), and the other looks like an expand or window control icon (two angled arrows).
- **Search Field**: Below these icons is a search bar with a magnifying glass icon and a placeholder text that reads "Search".
- **Recent Searches Section**: Text indicating "Recent Searches" and a note "No recent searches to display" showing there's no recent search history.

### Main Content Area
- Divided into sections by category:
    - **New Section**: Contains various template thumbnails like "Bullet Journal", "Daily Reflection Journal", "Gratitude Journal", "Personal Annual Review", "Reading Tracker”.
    - **Craft for Self-Improvement Section**: Another set, similar to the new section above, with repeated titles indicating these are templates related to self-improvement.
    - **People of Craft Section**: Displays what appears to be user profiles or stories from other app users, with photos and names (names are redacted for privacy).

### Right Sidebar
- More detailed section with a larger view of one of the templates labeled "Reading Tracker".
- A close button (“X”) in the upper right corner to presumably close this detail view.
- A header or title area reading "Templates", followed by a subtitle or description that says "Browse & Pick a template".
- A semi-transparent overlay containing text, which seems to offer guidance or information about the templates and app functionality. The text appears to include headings like "Start: get going" and bullet points with explanations, possibly tips or benefits of using the app.
- At the bottom of this panel, there are icons, possibly for scrolling or selecting different information sections within the overlay.
