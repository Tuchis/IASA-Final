In the image, you see a user interface for a seemingly modern application with a design that indicates it could be running on a desktop or tablet operating system that utilizes a contemporary flat-style UI theme.

Starting from the top, there are three small dots aligned horizontally which usually indicate a window control panel for minimizing, maximizing, or closing the window.

Below that on the left is a "<" back button, which is typically used to navigate to a previous page or menu; a square icon that indicates a functionality which could be related to window management or presenting additional options; and a "+" icon which is commonly associated with creating or adding something new within the app.

On the top right side, there are a series of icons: one that may represent a sharing feature, represented by three connected dots with two branching lines; a "heart" which usually stands for 'favorites' or 'like'; a bell icon perhaps representing notifications or alerts; and a magnifying glass which is a universal symbol for search functionality.

In the center, there appears to be a header or title bar with the text "New Sheet" and on the right side of this bar are the words "Cancel" and "Done," suggesting these are buttons for canceling or completing an action related to a new sheet or document.

Below the header, we see a large text field labeled "untitled sheet" with a placeholder text or a title that can presumably be edited by the user, and next to it, there is an "x" icon, which often serves to clear the entered text or close the element.

Moving on to the currency section, there is a button or dropdown menu with "UAH" indicating the current selection (Ukrainian Hryvnia, the currency of Ukraine), alongside text reading "Ukrainian Hryvnia" with a dropdown arrow suggesting that this menu can be expanded to select different options.

Further down, we have a section labeled "Advanced Settings" with two toggle options: "Show Total Balance" and "Show Currency Selection," both of which have checkmarks indicating these settings are currently active or enabled.

At the very bottom, we see descriptive text that reads "Select New Sheet to create a new sheet." and a graphic element that appears to be a button with a "+" icon and the text "New Sheet," potentially for creating a new sheet or document within the app.

Lastly, the overall background is a relatively flat grey, suggesting a modern or minimal design ethos, and the UI elements use a combination of darker and lighter shades of grey for different components, with the text primarily being black or similarly dark-colored for contrast.
