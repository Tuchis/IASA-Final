The image displays a user interface that seems to be from a finance or budget-related app. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's visible in the interface:

- In the top-left corner, there are three icons that are commonly used for navigation purposes in apps: three horizontal lines indicating a menu (sometimes referred to as a "hamburger" icon), two overlapping squares which could represent window or view options, and a back arrow which typically indicates a function to go back to the previous screen.

- Below the navigation icons, there is a sidebar that contains a tab labeled "Sheets" followed by a section with the title "Planner" and below it, a financial figure "-50,00 US$". The time "Today, 23:35" is indicated next to the financial figure suggesting a timestamp for this entry.

- At the bottom of the sidebar, there's an icon that probably represents the action to create a "New Sheet", indicated by the plus sign and text "New Sheet".

- The main content area of the interface has a header indicating "Export," with a smaller sub-header "Planner" which seems to be the name of the sheet or report that the user is attempting to export.

- There is a close icon (X) in the top-right corner of the modal or pop-up which would typically allow a user to close the window.

- The main content of the focused window includes a dropdown menu labeled "Export all images" followed by another dropdown menu with the label "All Time". Both of these dropdowns suggest that the user may have options to customize what they are exporting and for what time period.

- Below these dropdowns, there's a space that might be a list or form, but the elements within it are not discernible.

- At the bottom of this pop-up is a rectangular button labeled "Export" likely intended for the user to finalize the export action.

- On the top-right area of the screen outside the focused window, thereâ€™s a balance information repeated "-50,00 US$" and below is an icon that represents an option to switch views, plus a magnifying glass icon indicating search functionality.

- In the background, faintly visible, there seems to be repeating instances of the aforementioned balance figure "-50,00 US$" which likely belong to the interface or page that the export window is overlaying.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements.
