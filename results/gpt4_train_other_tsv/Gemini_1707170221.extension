This is the user interface screen for a software application called "Gemini." The UI is designed to indicate that a cleaning or de-duplication process has been completed. Here are the UI elements from this screenshot:

1. Title Bar:
   - In the top left, there are three dots that likely represent the standard window controls for minimizing, maximizing, and closing the window.
   - In the top right, there is a star icon which might represent a 'favorites' or 'bookmark' function.

2. Main Content Area:
   - A central circular graphic with a light green progress ring indicates the completion of a process. Inside the circle is a folder icon with "Nothing Remaining" written underneath it, which suggests that all unnecessary or duplicate files have been dealt with.
   - At the center top of the ring, the name "Gemini" appears, suggesting the branding of the application.
   - Just below that and in the central portion of the interface, in large text is "All Clean!"
   - Below the "All Clean!" message, there are two additional information texts: "1,9 MB" and "Successfully trashed" indicating the amount of data that has been removed during the last operation.
   - Underneath this, in smaller text: "1,9 MB Cleaned in Total" which might refer to the cumulative amount of data cleaned by the software.

3. Buttons and Social Media Icons:
   - On the bottom, there are two buttons:
     - "Review Trashed" which presumably allows users to review what was deleted during the last cleaning operation. This button is in a muted blue color, indicating it might be a secondary action.
     - "Start Over" which is highlighted in green, likely the primary call to action for users to initiate a new cleaning cycle.
   - On the bottom right of the interface, there are two icons representing Facebook and Twitter, suggesting that users can share their cleaning results on social media.

Please note that while the descriptions are built upon the UI elements, actual functionality may only be confirmed through the use of the application.
