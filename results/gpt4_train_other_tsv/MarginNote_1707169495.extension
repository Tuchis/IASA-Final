This image shows a user interface for what appears to be a document management or note-taking application. Here are the UI elements present in the image, starting from the top left corner and moving across and down:

1. In the top left corner, there is a magnifying glass icon, which presumably is a search function.
2. To the right of the search icon, there's a text tab with the word "New" highlighted in bold, indicating the current view is showing new documents or files.
3. At the top right, there are two dropdown selectors or filters. The first one is set to "All" with a downward arrow indicating more options when clicked. The second dropdown to its right has the text "Recent" highlighted, with another option "Name" visible below it, suggesting sorting or filtering by name is also available. 
4. Below the right corner dropdowns, there is a "Select" button, which likely enables the user to choose multiple documents.
5. The main area of the interface to the right shows a preview of a document or notebook. The preview includes a thumbnail with what appears to be a hierarchical outline or index, labeled "Function overview." Below the thumbnail is the title of the document, "MarginNote 3 Notebook Sample".
6. There are three dots "..." below the document title, which might bring up more options or actions related to the document when clicked.
7. On the far left sidebar, there are several icons:
   - At the top, there's a sidebar menu icon, which probably toggles the visibility of a sidebar menu.
   - Below, there are three icons with labels "Document", "Study", and "Review" respectively, which suggest different modes or modules of the application.
8. At the bottom left of the sidebar, there is a question mark icon, which likely leads to help resources or support.
9. Further down in the bottom left, there are three horizontal dots "..." indicating more options or an expandable menu could be present there.

The interface is clean and minimalist, offering a decluttered workspace. It seems that the main focus is on document management and review, with likely features for organizing, studying, and annotating documents.
