The UI interface appears to be from a note-taking or study-related application. Here's the detailed description of the elements present in the UI:

1. At the top left corner, there's a search bar represented by a magnifying glass icon.
2. Immediately to the right of the search bar, there are three colored dots—green, yellow, and red—which typically represent window controls for minimizing, going full screen, or closing the window on a macOS system.
3. In the center of the top bar, there's a label that says "New."
4. To the right, there are two tabs or buttons: "Recent" (highlighted as currently active or selected) and "Name" (not selected).
5. To the far right, there is a dropdown menu labeled "All ▼," indicating it can be clicked to show more options. Next to it, there's a "Select" button, suggesting the ability to select one or more items from the list.
6. Beneath these elements, on the far right corner, there are three vertical dots which is commonly an indicator for additional settings or options.

7. In the center, there's a card or a panel with multiple pieces of information:
    - A red number 7 in the top left corner and another 7 at the top right corner.

    - The second icon represents a link or connection, which may be associated with network or study function linking documents or notes.
    - The third icon resembles a graduation cap, usually associated with learning or study sections.
    - The fourth icon looks like an eye, which typically denotes review or view options.
    - At the bottom left corner, there's a question mark in a circle, indicating a help or support feature.
    - Just above the help icon, there are three horizontal dots, which might open up additional app settings or functionalities.

The background of the app UI is primarily a dark grey color with a lighter grey used for the main panel where the content is displayed. The UI has a modern, flat design with a minimalist approach.
