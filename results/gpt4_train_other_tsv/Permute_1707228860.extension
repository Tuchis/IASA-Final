The user interface of the app shown in the image appears to be a media or file conversion application named "Permute". Here is a description of the elements in the UI from the top to the bottom:

1. At the very top of the window, there's a title bar with three colored buttons on the left side (red, yellow, green) which represent close, minimize, and maximize actions in macOS. The title of the window is "Permute".

2. Below the title bar on the left side of the window is a sidebar with tabs. The active tab says "Audio" with a dropdown menu next to it – the selected option is "MP3".

3. In the larger right pane, at the top, there's a 'settings' or 'adjustment' gear icon on the right side.

4. Just below that, there is a section with what seems to be a draggable panel, possibly representing where files are added or the status of current operations. It includes a play button, an 'x' (possibly to remove items from the pane), and two icons that look like a square and speaker, potentially indicating the status or settings of the audio or video.

5. Below the draggable panel area, there's a divider line and a smaller panel or interface element. It includes a play button on the left side and the text "1 Conversion" next to it, suggesting there is an active or queued conversion task.

6. At the bottom of the main pane, there is a bar that includes a play button on the left side and a larger button with a "+" on it and a camera icon, likely for adding new files. There's also text that repeats "1 Conversion" with an "x", suggesting the ability to cancel the conversion or clear the queue.

7. Throughout the interface, there are several grayed-out icons that are hard to discern, indicating functionalities that are possibly disabled at the moment or context-sensitive.

8. Additionally, on the left side of the screen within the sidebar, there is an item listed "alarm" with metadata underneath saying "MP3 • 256 kbps • 1 MB", indicating the file format, bitrate, and file size respectively.

The UI elements are laid out in a way that suggests a workflow of selecting media type (Audio, Video, etc.), adding files, choosing a format (MP3, etc.), and managing the conversion process.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements.
