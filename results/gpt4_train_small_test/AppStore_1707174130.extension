2. "Arcade" - represented by a joystick icon.
3. "Create" - represented by a pen tip icon.
4. "Work" - represented by a briefcase icon.

6. "Develop" - represented by a curly braces {} icon.
7. "Categories" - represented by a grid icon.
8. "Updates" - represented by a circular arrow icon, with a red notification badge showing the number "5".

The user's profile picture or avatar is shown at the bottom of the sidebar, with the username "Mariya Hirna".

The main panel on the right is titled "Updates" with a subheading "Available". Below this heading, there is a button for "Update All".

The following software updates are listed:
1. "GarageBand" - With its icon shown, dated "5 Dec 2023". The description mentions "This update includes stability improvements and bug fixes". An "Update" button is located next to the date, and a "more" link is next to the description.

There's a horizontal line separating different software updates shown.

2. "iMovie" - With its icon and a violet star, dated "30 Nov 2023". The description states "Export HEVC and H.264 files faster by simultaneously processing video segments across available media engines". An "Update" button and a "more" link are present as well.

Below this, there are three smaller software updates listed, each accompanied by an "Update" button and a "more" link:

1. "Keynote" - With its icon displayed, dated "21 Sep 2023". The description includes "Bring new dimension to your presentations with 3D objects in USDZ format".

2. "Numbers" - With its icon shown, also dated "21 Sep 2023". The description includes "Bring new dimension to your spreadsheets with 3D objects in USDZ format".

3. "Pages" - With its icon visible, again dated "21 Sep 2023". Similarly mentions "Bring new dimension to your documents with 3D objects in USDZ format".

Each individual software update entry is separated by horizontal lines.

Overall, the user interface appears to be clean, well-organized, and uses a combination of icons, text descriptions, and buttons to guide the user through updating their installed applications.
