The interface you have provided is a screenshot from what appears to be a settings page of a code editor or development environment application similar to Visual Studio Code. Let's go through each element in detail:

On the top-left corner, there are three horizontal lines which typically indicate a menu button. Next to it is the label "Settings" signifying the user is currently on the settings page, followed by a close button "X" to presumably close the settings tab.

Below this top bar is a search box with the placeholder text "Search settings," which allows the user to filter and find specific settings.

On the far left column, there is a vertical navigation pane with a series of icons at the top and bottom. These icons are not labeled, but from top to bottom they could correspond to account settings, notifications, and various other settings like appearance, editor configuration, and extensions management.

The navigation pane itself has the following categories under "User":

- Text Editor
- Workbench
- Window
- Features
- Application
- Security
- Extensions

Each category is represented as an expandable item denoted by the ">" icon which suggests there are more options or settings within each.

In the center of the UI, there are two main columns. The left column lists the categories of settings and the right column shows the settings related to the selected category. Since "Commonly Used" is highlighted on the left, the right column is displaying settings that fall under this heading.

Under "Commonly Used," the settings visible are:

1. "Files: Auto Save" – with a dropdown showing "off", controls auto-saving behavior of the editor for unsaved changes.
2. "Editor: Font Size" – equipped with a horizontal slider, allowing to control the font size in pixels. The value is currently set to "12".
3. "Editor: Font Family" – a text field containing "Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace", which indicates the current font family being used.
4. "Editor: Tab Size (Modified elsewhere)" – followed by explanatory text about the number of spaces a tab is equal to. This is overridden based on file contents when "Editor: Detect Indentation" is on. It displays a numeric value "4".
5. "Editor: Render Whitespace" – with a dropdown currently set to "selection", controls how the editor should render whitespace characters.

In the top-right corner of the UI, there is a set of standard window control buttons that allow you to minimize, restore down/up, or close the application window. To the left of these buttons, there is an icon representing syncing functionality with the text "Last synced: 2 mos ago," indicating the last time settings were synchronized.

At the very bottom-left corner, there is an alert or notification icon with the number "1" indicating there is one notification or message for the user to check.

Finally, there are status indicators at the bottom center of the window, which are not fully visible in the screenshot but usually show information about the project or editor status, like errors or warnings count, language mode, encoding, line endings type, indentation settings, etc.
