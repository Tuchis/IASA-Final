This image displays a user interface for configuring touch bar settings for an application. The UI is divided into three main columns, each with its own set of controls and information:

**Leftmost Column:**
- At the very top, the window control buttons typical for macOS apps: the red, yellow, and green dots for closing, minimizing, and expanding the window, respectively.
- Below it, there's a sidebar navigation menu with "All Apps" highlighted in blue, indicating it's the selected view. Below it is an icon for "Finder" with a blue vertical bar next to it, also suggesting it's the selected item within the "All Apps" category.
- At the bottom of the left column, there are two icons: a plus sign and a trash can, indicating functions for adding and removing items, respectively.

**Middle Column:**
- At the top, there are arrows indicating backward and forward navigation (the backward arrow highlighted), a title of the section that reads ". Touch Bar" with an icon next to it representing the touch bar, and a pencil icon for editing.
- Below the title, it reads "Groups & Top Level Triggers" with a subtitle of "Enter Touch Bar Button Name" and a text field with the prefilled placeholder "Name". Below that, there is more text that reads "Action: Move/Resize: -".
- There is a button with the placeholder "Please Select a Trigger" suggesting a dropdown menu or selection interface.
- Two large blue plus signs are visible, one below the "Enter Touch Bar Button Name" and the other in the adjacent Actions column, presumably for adding new triggers or actions.

**Rightmost Column:**
- At the top, there are several UI elements: three icons which seem to represent different view options or states (two squares, a pause symbol, and list or menu lines), the text "Preset: Default" suggesting you are currently viewing a default set of touch bar settings, and a three-dot menu for additional options.
- The main section has the heading "Actions Assigned to Selected Trigger" and directly below it, the words "Move/Resize: -" with a leftward arrow, and a large plus sign, likely for adding new actions to the selected trigger.
- The "Action Configuration" area below includes a dropdown menu with the selected option "Custom Move / Resize Window," an "Add additional action" link for more configurations, and an invitation to "Click here to configure the custom move / resize:" followed by a "Configure Move / Resize" button.
- There is another instance of "Move/Resize: -" at the bottom of this column, which correlates to the action selected or being configured.

This interface is focused on customizing touch bar actions for apps on macOS, allowing a user to define certain triggers and actions when using the touch bar. The UI uses a combination of text fields, buttons, and dropdown menus to allow users to input and configure settings.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
