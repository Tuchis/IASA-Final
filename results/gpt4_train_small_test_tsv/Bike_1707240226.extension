The interface image presented appears to be a settings menu for an autocorrect feature within a text editor or word processor application. Below is a detailed description of the user interface elements visible in the screenshot:

1. **Window Controls and Application Name**: At the top left corner, there are three window control buttons typical for a macOS application: red (close), yellow (minimize), and green (maximize/full-screen). The name of the current settings pane is displayed in the center, "Autocorrect."

2. **Settings Categories**: Below the window controls and application name, a toolbar is visible with six icons indicating different settings categories:
    - A gear icon labeled "General"
    - A file icon labeled "Document"
    - A chain/link icon labeled "Links"
    - A squiggly line that could be a representation of text labeled "Editor," which is highlighted suggesting this is the currently selected category.
    - "AI," accompanied by "abc," labeled "Autocorrect," which is also highlighted indicating it is part of the current selection.
    - An icon resembling a sandbox labeled "Sandbox"
    - A key icon labeled "License"

3. **Autocorrect Settings**: Beneath the settings categories, the following autocorrect settings and their descriptions are presented in three groups, each option having a blue checkmark indicating they are enabled:
   
   **Spelling**:
   - "Correct spelling"
   - "Capitalize words"

   **Formatting**:
   - "Use smart links"
   - "Use smart quotes"
   - "Use smart dashes"
   - "Use smart row types" with additional explanatory text: "When enabled use markdown inspired shortcuts to set row types. For example, type # to create a heading. Learn more in the user's guide."

   **Replacements**:
   - "Use text replacements"
   - "Use double-space for period"

   **Undo**:
   - "Use delete to undo autocorrections" with accompanying explanation: "When enabled press the Delete key immediately after an autocorrection to undo the correction. This can be easier than using Command-Z to Undo."

Each setting can presumably be toggled on and off by clicking or tapping the checkmark beside it.

This detailed description should be adequate to answer questions about the UI and the autocorrect feature of this specific application.
