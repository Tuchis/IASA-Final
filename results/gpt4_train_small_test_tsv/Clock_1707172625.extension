The image appears to show the interface of a world clock application, most likely on a tablet or large-screen device given the aspect ratio. Here's the breakdown of the UI elements:

- At the top left, there are three dots aligned horizontally, colored green, yellow, and red, which indicate window control buttons typical of macOS for closing, minimizing, and maximizing the window, respectively.

- Right next to the window control buttons, centrally aligned at the top of the screen, are the tabs for different functions of the app: "World Clock," which is the currently active tab highlighted in white text, "Alarms," "Stopwatch," and "Timers." These are navigation tabs to switch between different functionalities of the app.

- On the top right corner of the screen, there is a "+" button, likely used for adding new clocks or alarms.

- The central part of the interface shows a dark map of the world with a shaded area indicating nighttime. A white curve delineates the transition between night and day on the globe.

- There is a label over London with an indicator pointing to the location on the map. To the right of the indicator is text saying "London 22:37," which indicates the current time in London.

- On the bottom left corner, there is an analog clock with its hands pointing to approximately 10:37. It's an additional, more visual representation of the current time in London. Below the analog clock is text:
  - "London, 22:37" confirming the digital time corresponding to the same time shown by the analog clock.
  - "Today, -1 HR" which may indicate that London is currently one hour behind the user's local time, or it could mean a change in time due to daylight saving adjustments.
  - "Sunrise: 07:31" which likely indicates the time of the sunrise in London.

The interface uses a monochrome color scheme, which is easy on the eyes and suitable for low-light conditions. The UI design is minimalistic and serves the function of displaying times in different locations around the world with both digital and analog options.

Here is the representation of the same UI elements. It has additional information, as coordinates of the elements. You can use this information to connect the representation with the UI elements that are present at the screen and were described above.
