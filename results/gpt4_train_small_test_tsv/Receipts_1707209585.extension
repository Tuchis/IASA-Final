The image displays a user interface of what appears to be a document or receipt management application. The UI is divided into several sections with different elements involved. Here's a detailed breakdown:

On the top left side, there are three window control buttons typical for macOS:
- A red "close" button
- A yellow "minimize" button
- A green "maximize" button

Below the window controls, the directory path "Receipts.receipts" is visible, indicating the current location or file in the application.

On the top right side, there are three icons:
- Two overlapping rectangles that likely represent a "toggle sidebar" button
- A list icon that may toggle a different view or panel
- A "Search" bar with a magnifying glass icon and a text field where users can input search queries

On the left-hand section of the interface, there's a sidebar with various filters or sections that users might click to sort or view their documents:
- "All," represented by a square icon with lines (probably the view of all documents)
- "Unconfirmed," indicated by a circle icon with a dot in the middle
- "Not Paid," symbolized by a circle icon 
- "Starred," represented by a star icon
- "Without Attachments," illustrated by a paperclip icon
- "Recent Imports," which has an icon suggestive of download or import action
- "Trash," represented by a trash bin icon

Below the filters, there's a category named "JOURNAL" with a dropdown arrow indicating collapsibility, followed by months "January" through "October" for the year 2023, suggesting these are filters to view documents by month.

In the lower left corner, there is a "+" button that likely serves as a way to add new items or create new entries in the application.

The main section in the middle-top is titled "Export Content" and lists options for exporting documents with checkboxes to select preferences:
- "Documents as PDF" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Formatted with recognized values" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Single PDF File for each Receipt" with a radio button (selected)
- "One Combined PDF File" with a radio button (not selected)
- "Excel File" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Grouped by Categories" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "Show +/- signs" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "CSV File" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "JSON File" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "DATEV" with a checkbox (not ticked)

Below this section, there is another subsection titled "Option":
- "Archive as ZIP File" with a checkbox (not ticked)

At the bottom of this middle section, there is a "?" button labeled "Configure Templates," presumably for setting up export templates.

The next section on the right is titled "Columns" and lists various columns that can be included in the export file with checkboxes to select which columns are included:
- "Reference" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "Date" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Paid" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "Contact" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Category" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Tags" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Title" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "Export File Name" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "Note" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Currency" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "Tax" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "Amount" with a checkbox (not ticked)
- "Tax in UAH" with a checkbox (ticked)
- "Net in UAH" with a checkbox (ticked)

On the bottom right-side of the screen, there are two buttons:
- "Cancel," likely used to exit the export dialog without saving changes
- "Export..." (partially obscured), which is the button to proceed with the export process as configured

Right below these buttons, there's an element that says "Report" with a paper icon and an upward arrow, indicating an export or save action.
