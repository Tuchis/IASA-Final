Across the top of the entire window, the application's menu bar includes standard window controls for close, minimize, and full-screen (red, yellow, and green dots, respectively).

This interface is designed to allow users to configure their experience and track stock prices, giving the option to automatically update the prices and manually fetch the latest data. The left part of the interface seems to navigate through different settings or functionalities of the app, with the "Stocks" function currently being active.
