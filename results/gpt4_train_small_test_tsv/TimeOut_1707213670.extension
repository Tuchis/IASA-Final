1. Title/Header: "Welcome to Time Out"

2. Introduction text: Explains the purpose of the "Time Out" application, which is to help users stay or get healthy by taking regular breaks. It suggests that the application includes two types of breaks that can be customized.

3. "Normal" break settings:
   - Checkbox and Label: "Include a Normal break" (Checkbox is ticked)
   - Break duration setting: "How long do you want this break to last?" followed by a dropdown menu with "10 minutes" selected.
   - Break frequency setting: "How often do you want the breaks to occur?" followed by a dropdown menu with "1 hour" selected.
   - Additional instruction: "(Want less than an hour? No problem: select the units and use up/down arrows, or type, or click again to show a menu.)"

4. "Micro" break settings:
   - Checkbox and Label: "Include a Micro break" (Checkbox is ticked)
   - Break duration setting: "How long do you want this break to last?" followed by a dropdown menu with "15 seconds" selected.
   - Break frequency setting: "How often do you want the breaks to occur?" followed by a dropdown menu with "15 minutes" selected.

5. Explanation of "Micro" breaks: Text providing information about what "Micro" breaks are and how they should be utilized.

6. Skip Option:
   - Additional instruction: "Click Skip to close this setup assistant and set things up manually, or Continue the setup. (You can always come back to this later if you wish.)"
   - Skip Button: The button labeled "Skip" allows the user to exit the setup assistant and configure settings manually, as noted in the additional instruction.

7. Continue Option:
   - Continue Button: The button labeled "Continue" likely takes the user to the next step in the setup process.

The UI elements such as checkboxes, buttons, and dropdown menus are standard components for configuration interfaces. They allow users to customize their preferences for how frequently and how long breaks should occur. The instructions and labels are clear and direct, aimed at ensuring the user understands the purpose and functionality of each setting.
