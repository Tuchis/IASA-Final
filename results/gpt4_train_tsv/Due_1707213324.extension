In the UI interface of this app, the following elements are displayed:

1. At the top left corner, there are three horizontal lines, suggesting a menu or navigation drawer icon.
2. Below the navigation drawer icon, there are three vertically lined icons designated for different functionalities or sections of the app:
   - The first icon appears to represent "Reminders."
   - The second icon signifies "Timers."
   - The third icon looks to be a "Logbook."
3. In the center towards the top is a search bar with a magnifying glass icon and the placeholder text "Search."
4. In the main area of the interface, there is a graphic of a bell with a facial expression and a speech bubble containing an exclamation mark.
5. Below the graphic:
   - There is a large text message stating "Due cannot remind you." This is presumably the title of the notification.
   - A smaller explanatory text follows which reads, "You have turned off notifications for Due."
6. Below the explanatory text, there is a button labeled "System Preferences."
7. At the very bottom of the left-side menu, there is a triangle with an exclamation mark inside it, likely an alert or warning sign.
8. Below the alert sign, there is a "+" (plus) sign.

These elements together form a user interface designed to alert the user that notifications for the app "Due" have been turned off and provide a direct link via the "System Preferences" button to presumably change this setting.
