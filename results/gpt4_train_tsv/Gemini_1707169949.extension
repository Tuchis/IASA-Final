In the UI interface for the app depicted in this image, several elements are present:

1. On the top left corner, there is a set of three horizontal dots which typically represents a menu or more options.

2. Across the top, in the center, there is the name of the application, "Gemini".

3. On the top right corner, there is a star icon, which often signifies a favorites or bookmark function.

4. In the middle left area, there is an icon of a folder titled "Projects".

5. Centered in the middle of the screen, there is a larger text that reads "Estimating...".

6. Directly beneath this, is smaller text that says "Building folder map...".

7. Below this text, there is a button labeled "Stop".

These elements appear to be part of a process where the application is analyzing or scanning a directory titled "Projects", likely searching for duplicates or similar files, as the name "Gemini" could suggest (possibly related to finding twins or duplicates). The "Stop" button is presumably there to allow the user to cancel or interrupt the estimation process.
