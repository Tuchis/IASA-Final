This is a user interface for an application, likely a document management or note-taking app. Here's the description of various UI elements visible in the image:

1. Top-left section:
   - A back-arrow icon that seems to act as a navigation button to go back.
   - The word "Import" indicating that this section is perhaps for importing documents or files.

2. Top section, towards the center:
   - A folder navigation system with the word "Folder:" followed by the dropdown menu labeled "Root," suggesting that the user can navigate through different folders.
   - A button labeled "Select" which may be used for selecting items or files listed in the interface.

3. Just beneath the folder navigation system:
   - Two tabs or sorting options, one is labeled "Recent" and the other is labeled "Name," which are likely used to sort or filter the items in the view.

4. At the top-right corner:
   - A three-dot icon arranged vertically which often signifies a menu or additional options.

5. Left-hand sidebar:
   - Icons that seem to represent different functionalities or sections of the app labeled "Document," "Study," "Review," and a question mark which typically indicates help or support information. Below these, there is another three-dot icon for possibly more options or settings.

6. In the main content area:
   - Two items are displayed representing documents or files. The first one looks like a folder and has text below it that reads "MarginNote 3 User Guide videos," which suggests it might contain tutorial videos for the MarginNote 3 app. Next to it, the second item appears to be a PDF document with "PDF" written in the upper right corner and the beginning text "An article from MarginNot..." followed by the file's page count of "58." Below both items, there are ellipsis (three-dot) icons, potentially indicating more actions or information.

7. Across the bottom of the interface:
   - A scrollbar indicating the ability to scroll horizontally through the content.

Please note that the actual functionality of these buttons and elements can only be confirmed by using the application.
